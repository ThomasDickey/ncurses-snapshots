.SH DESCRIPTION
.SS "Reading Characters"
.B \%wgetch
gathers a key event from the terminal keyboard associated with a
.I curses
window
.IR win "."
\fB\%ncurses\fP(3X) describes the variants of this function.
.PP
When input is pending,
.B \%wgetch
returns an integer identifying the key event;
for alphanumeric and punctuation keys,
the space bar,
and (usually) the Backspace,
Tab,
Return,
and Escape keys,
this value corresponds to the character encoding used by the terminal.
Use of the control key as a modifier,
by holding it down while pressing and releasing another key,
often results in a distinct code.
The behavior of other keys depends on whether
.I win
is in keypad mode;
see subsection \*(``Keypad Mode\*('' below.
.PP
If no input is pending,
then if the no-delay flag is set in the window
(see \fB\%nodelay\fP(3X)),
the function returns
.BR ERR ";"
otherwise,
.I curses
waits until the terminal has input.
If \fB\%cbreak\fP(3X) or \fB\%raw\fP(3X)
has been called,
this happens after
.I curses
reads one key event.
If \fB\%nocbreak\fP(3X) or \fB\%noraw\fP(3X)
has been called,
it occurs when
.I curses
reads a newline. \" "newline" because canonical mode normalizes NL/CR
(Because the terminal's canonical or \*(``cooked\*('' mode
is line-buffered,
multiple
.B \%wgetch
calls may then be necessary to empty the input queue.)
If \fB\%halfdelay\fP(3X)
has been called,
.I curses
waits until input is available or the specified delay elapses.
.PP
If \fB\%echo\fP(3X) has been called,
and the window is not a pad,
.I curses
writes the returned character
.I c
to the window
(at the cursor position)
per the following rules.
.bP
If
.I c
matches the terminal's erase character
(see \fB\%erasechar\fP(3X)),
and the cursor is not at the window's leftmost column,
the cursor moves leftward one position
and the new position is erased
as if \fB\%wmove\fP(3X) and then \fB\%wdelch\fP(3X) were called.
When the window's keypad mode is enabled
(see below),
.B \%KEY_LEFT
and
.B \%KEY_BACKSPACE
are handled the same way.
.bP
.I curses
writes any other
.I c
to the window,
as with \fB\%wechochar\fP(3X).
.bP
If the window
.I win
has been moved or modified since the last call to
\fB\%wrefresh\fP(3X),
.I curses
calls
.B \%wrefresh
on it.
.PP
If
.I c
is a carriage return and \fBnl\fP(3X) has been called,
.B \%wgetch
returns the character code for line feed instead.
.SS "Keypad Mode"
Call \fB\%keypad\fP(3X) on a window to configure keypad mode
when reading input from it.
In
.IR "keypad mode" ","
.I curses
treats key strokes not from the alphabetic section of the keyboard
(those corresponding to the ECMA-6 character set \(em
see \fI\%ascii\fP(7) \(em
optionally modified by either the control or shift keys)
as
.I function
keys.
(In
.IR curses ","
the term \*(``function key\*('' includes but is not limited to keycaps
engraved with \*(``F1\*('',
\*(``PF1\*('',
and so on.)
If a window is in keypad mode,
.B \%wgetch
translates these key strokes to a numeric code corresponding to the
.B KEY_
symbols listed in subsection \*(``Key Codes\*('' below.
If the window is not in keypad mode,
the input queue populates with
the characters of the function key's escape sequence,
which the application must collect individually with multiple
.B \%wgetch
calls.
.bP
The
.I \%curses.h
header file declares many
.I "function keys"
whose names begin with
.BR KEY_ ";"
these object-like macros
have integer values outside the range of eight-bit character codes.
.bP
In
.IR \%ncurses ","
.I "user-defined function keys"
are configured with \fB\%define_key\fP(3X);
they have no names,
but are also expected to
have integer values outside the range of eight-bit character codes.
.PP
A variable intended to hold a function key code must thus be of type
.I short
or larger.
.PP
Most terminals one encounters follow the ECMA-48 standard insofar as
their function keys produce character sequences prefixed with the
escape character ESC.
This fact implies that
.I curses
cannot distinguish a user's press of the escape key
(assuming it sends ESC)
from the beginning of a function key's character sequence without
waiting to see if,
and how soon,
further input arrives.
.bP
If the escape sequence
matches a string capability defining a function key
for the terminal type
(such as
.B \%key_home
.RB \%( khome )
or
.B \%key_up
.RB \%( kuu1 )),
.B \%wgetch
returns the function key code corresponding to the unique sequence
defined by the terminal.
.bP
If the escape sequence matches no function keys
defined for the terminal type,
call
.B \%wgetch
repeatedly to obtain
the codes of the individual characters of the sequence,
in the order they occurred in the input.
.bP
If
.B \%wgetch
cannot decide the validity of the input as a function key
because it has not read enough characters to disambiguate it,
the function waits until it has this information or the
.I "escape delay"
elapses.
Configure the escape delay
with the global variable
.BR \%ESCDELAY ","
an extension
(see section \*(``EXTENSIONS\*('' below),
or the environment variable of the same name
(see section \*(``ENVIRONMENT\*('' of \fB\%ncurses\fP(3X)),
also an extension.
.PP
Consequently,
a user of a
.I curses
application that employs keypad mode
may experience a pause or \*(``hang\*(''
after pressing the escape key while
.I curses
collects sufficient characters to disambiguate the input.
If the window is in \*(``no time-out\*('' mode,
the escape delay is effectively infinite;
see \fB\%notimeout\fP(3X).
In the event of such a pause,
further typing \*(``awakens\*(''
.IR curses "."
.SS "Ungetting Characters"
.B \%ungetch
places
.I c
into the input queue to be returned by the next call to
.BR \%wgetch "."
A single input queue serves all windows associated with the screen.
.SS "Key Codes"
The header file
.I \%curses.h
defines the following function key codes.
.bP
Except for the special case of
.BR \%KEY_RESIZE ","
a window's keypad mode must be enabled for
.B \%wgetch
to read these codes from it.
.bP
Not all of these are necessarily supported on any particular terminal.
.bP
The naming convention may seem obscure,
with some apparent misspellings
(such as \*(``RSUME\*('' for \*(``resume\*('');
the names correspond to the
.I \%term\%info
capability names for the keys,
and were standardized before the IBM PC/AT keyboard layout achieved a
dominant position in industry.

which cannot happen if \fB\%nodelay\fP(3X) is in effect on the window.
.PP
In

.B \%wgetch
also fails if
.bP
the
.I curses
screen has not been initialized,
.bP
(for functions taking a
.I \%WINDOW

.SH NOTES
.BR \%getch ","
.BR \%mvgetch ","
and
.B \%mvwgetch
may be implemented as macros.
.PP
.I curses
discourages assignment of the ESC key to a discrete function by the
programmer because the library requires a delay while it awaits the
potential remainder of a terminal escape sequence.
.PP
Some key strokes are indistinguishable from control characters;
for example,
.B \%KEY_ENTER
may be the same as
.BR \*^M ","
.\" as with att630 or pccon+keys
and
.B \%KEY_BACKSPACE
may be the same as
.B \*^H
.\" as with att505 or vt52-basic
or
.BR \*^? "."
.\" as with pccon+keys or vt320
Consult the
.I \%term\%info
entry for the terminal type to determine whether this is the case;
see \fB\%infocmp\fP(1).
Some
.I curses
implementations,
including
.IR \%ncurses ","
honor the
.I \%term\%info
key definitions;
others treat such control characters specially.
.PP
.I curses
distinguishes the Enter keys in the alphabetic and numeric keypad
sections of a keyboard because (most) terminals do.
.B \%KEY_ENTER
refers to the key on the numeric keypad and,
like other function keys,
is reliably recognized only if the window's keypad mode is enabled.
.bP
The
.I \%term\%info
.B \%key_enter
.RB ( kent )
capability describes the character (sequence) sent by the Enter key of
a terminal's numeric
(or similar)
keypad.
.bP
\*(``Enter or send\*('' is X/Open Curses's description of this key.
.PP
.I curses
treats the Enter or Return key in the
.I alphabetic
section of the keyboard differently.
.bP
It usually produces a control code for carriage return
.RB ( \*^M )
or line feed
.RB ( \*^J ).
.bP
Depending on the terminal mode
(raw,
cbreak,
or
canonical),
and whether \fB\%nl\fP(3X) or \fB\%nonl\fP(3X) has been called,
.B \%wgetch
may return either a carriage return or line feed upon an Enter or Return
key stroke.
.PP
Use of
.B \%wgetch
with \fB\%echo\fP(3X) and neither \fB\%cbreak\fP(3X) nor \fB\%raw\fP(3X)
is not well-defined.
.PP
Historically,
the list of key code macros above was influenced by the keyboard of the
AT&T 7300
(also known variously as the \*(``3B1\*('', \*(``Safari 4\*('', and
\*(``UNIX PC\*(''),
a 1985 machine rich in function keys.

when a window's \*(``no time-out\*('' mode is
.I not
set,
the

function key character sequence from a series of key strokes beginning
with ESC typed by the user;
see

.PP
Except as noted in section \*(``EXTENSIONS\*('' above,
X/Open Curses Issue\ 4 describes these functions.
It specifies no error conditions for them.

.I \%wgetch
reads only single-byte characters.

or backspace characters is not documented in SVr4
.IR curses "."
.PP
The behavior of
.I \%wgetch
in the presence of signal handlers is not documented in SVr4
.I curses
and is unspecified by X/Open Curses.
In historical
.I curses
implementations,
it varied depending on whether the operating system's dispatch of a
signal to a handler interrupted a \fIread\fP(2) call in progress,
and also
(in some implementations)
whether an input timeout or non-blocking mode had been set.
A portable
.I curses
application prepares for two cases:
(a) signal receipt does not interrupt
.IR \%wgetch ";"
and
(b) signal receipt interrupts
.I \%wgetch
and causes it to return
.I ERR
with
.I \%errno
set to
.IR \%EINTR "."
.PP
.I \%KEY_MOUSE
is mentioned in X/Open Curses,
along with a few related
