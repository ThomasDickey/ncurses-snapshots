.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@INFOTOCAP@\fP [\fB\-v\fP\fIn\fP \fIwidth\fP]  [\fB\-V\fP] [\fB\-1\fP] [\fB\-w\fP \fIwidth\fP] \fIfile\fP ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fB@INFOTOCAP@\fP looks in each given text
\fIfile\fP for \fBterminfo\fP descriptions.
For each terminfo description found,
an equivalent \fBtermcap\fP description is written to standard output.
Terminfo \fBuse\fP capabilities are translated directly to termcap
\fBtc\fP capabilities.
