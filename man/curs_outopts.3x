.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions configure properties of
.I curses
windows that affect their manner of output.
Boolean-valued properties are initially
.B FALSE
except where noted.
\fBendwin\fP(3X) resets any terminal modes corresponding to these
properties;
an application need not restore their initial values.
.SS clearok
Setting
.IR win 's
.B \%clearok
property to
.B TRUE
causes the next
.B \%wrefresh
call on it to clear the terminal screen and redraw it entirely.
This property is useful to restore the contents of the screen
(perhaps because another process has written to the terminal),
or in some cases to achieve a more pleasing visual effect.
If
.I \%win
is
.B \%curscr
(see \fBcurs_variables\fP(3X)),
the next
.B \%wrefresh
call on
.I any
window causes the terminal screen to clear and redraw as above.
.B \%wrefresh
resets this property to
.BR FALSE "."
.SS idcok
(This property defaults
.BR TRUE ".)"
Setting
.IR win 's
.B \%idcok
property to
.B FALSE
prevents
.I curses
from using the insert/delete character capabilities of terminal types
possessing them according to the
.I \%term\%info
database.
.SS idlok
Setting
.IR win 's
.B \%idlok
property to
.B TRUE
causes
.I curses
to consider
using the insert/delete line capabilities of terminal types
possessing them according to the
.I \%term\%info
database.
Enable this option
if the application explicitly requires these operations,
as a full-screen text editor might;
otherwise the results may be visually annoying to the user.
.\" TODO: Substantiate that claim.
.SS immedok
If
.B \%immedok
is called with
.B TRUE
as second argument,
changes to the window image,
such as those caused by
.BR \%waddch ","
.BR \%wclrtobot ","
or
.BR \%wscrl ","
automatically cause a call to
.BR wrefresh "."
Setting a window's
.B \%immedok
property may degrade performance considerably
if writes are frequent.
Calling
.B \%immedok
with
.B FALSE
as second argument
restores the default behavior,
deferring screen updates until a refresh is needed
or explicitly directed by the application.
.SS leaveok
Normally,
.I curses
leaves the hardware cursor at the library's cursor location
of the window being refreshed.
The
.B \%leaveok
option allows the cursor to be left
wherever the update happens to leave it.
It is useful for applications that do not employ a visible cursor,
since it reduces the need for cursor motions.
.SS scrollok
The
.B \%scrollok
option controls what happens when a window's cursor
moves off the edge of the window or scrolling region,
as a result of either
(1) writing a newline anywhere on its bottom line,
or
(2) writing a character that advances the cursor to the last position
on its bottom line.
If disabled
.RI ( bf
is
.BR FALSE "),"
.I curses
leaves the cursor on the bottom line of the window.
If enabled
.RI ( bf
is
.BR TRUE "),"
.I curses
scrolls the window up one line.
(To get the physical scrolling effect on the terminal,
the application must also enable
.BR idlok ")."
.SS "setscrreg, wsetscrreg"
The
.B \%wsetscrreg
and
.B \%setscrreg
functions allow the application
to set a software scrolling region in the specified window or
.BR \%stdscr ","
respectively.
The
.I top
and
.I bot
parameters
are the line numbers of the top and bottom margin of the scrolling
region.
If this option and
.B scrollok
are enabled,
an attempt to move off the bottom margin line
causes all lines in the scrolling region
to scroll one line in the direction of the first line.
Only the text of the window is scrolled.
(This process has nothing to do
with the scrolling region capability of the terminal,
as found in the DEC VT100.)
If
.B \%idlok
is enabled and the terminal
has either a scrolling region or insert/delete line capability,
they will probably be used by the output routines.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The functions
.B \%setscrreg
and
.B \%wsetscrreg
return
.B OK
upon success
and
.B ERR
upon failure.
All other routines that return an integer always
return
.BR OK "."
.PP
In
.IR \%ncurses ","
these functions fail if
.bP
the
.I curses
screen has not been initialized,
.bP
(for functions taking a
.I \%WINDOW
pointer argument)
.I win
is a null pointer,
or
.bP
(for
.B \%setscrreg
and
.BR \%wsetscrreg ")"
the function is passed arguments describing a scrolling region
with limits that extend outside the window boundaries.
.SH NOTES
.BR \%clearok ","
.BR \%leaveok ","
.BR \%scrollok ","
.BR \%idcok ","
and
.B \%setscrreg
may be implemented as macros.
.PP
Unlike the other functions described by this page,
.B \%setscrreg
does not accept a
.RI pointer-to- WINDOW
parameter,
but operates on
.BR stdscr "."
Use
.B \%wsetscrreg
to configure the scrolling region of a selected window.
.PP
Historically,
applications used
.B \%idcok(FALSE)
to accommodate the \*(``magic cookie\*('' feature
of some terminal types;
see subsection \*(``Highlighting, Underlining, and Visible Bells\*(''
of \fB\%terminfo\fP(5).
When updating a line,
the presence of character cells with magic cookies in them
made the
.I curses
library's computations of characters to be rewritten inaccurate.
A better solution is to indicate the
.B \%magic_cookie_glitch
.RB ( xmc )
capability in the terminal's type description.
.PP
.B \%immedok
is useful for windows that are used as terminal emulators.
.SH PORTABILITY
X/Open Curses Issue\ 4 describes these functions.
It specifies no error conditions for them.
.PP
Some historic
.I curses
implementations,
as an undocumented feature,
did the equivalent of
.RB \*(`` \%clearok( .\|.\|. ", 1)" \*(''
when
.B \%touchwin(stdstr)
or
.B \%clear(stdstr)
were used.
This trick does not work with
.IR \%ncurses .
.PP
Early System\ V
.I curses
implementations specified that with
.I \%scrollok
enabled,
any window modification triggering a scroll
also forced a physical refresh.
X/Open Curses does not require this,
and
.I \%ncurses
avoids doing so to better optimize vertical motions upon a
.IR \%wrefresh "."
.PP
X/Open Curses does not mention that the cursor should be
made invisible as a side-effect of
.IR \%leaveok "."
SVr4
.I curses
documentation notes this behavior,
but the code neglects to implement it.
Use \fB\%curs_set\fP(3X) to make the cursor invisible.
.SH HISTORY
4BSD (1980)
introduced
.IR \%clearok ","
.IR \%leaveok ","
and
.IR \%scrollok "."
.PP
SVr2 (1984)

.IR \%setscrreg ","
and
.IR \%wsetscrreg "."
.PP
SVr3.1 (1987)
implemented
.I \%idcok
and
.IR \%immedok "."
.PP
.I \%ncurses
formerly treated
.I nl
and
.I nonl
as both input
.I and
output options,
but no longer;
see \fB\%curs_inopts\fP(3X).
