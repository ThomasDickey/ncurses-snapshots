.SH NAME
\fBform_field\fP \- make and break connections between fields and forms
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <form.h>\fP
.sp
\fBint set_form_fields(FORM *\fP\fIform\fP\fB, FIELD **\fP\fIfields\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBFIELD **form_fields(const FORM *\fP\fIform\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBint field_count(const FORM *\fP\fIform\fP\fB);\fP
.br
\fBint move_field(FIELD *\fP\fIfield\fP\fB, int \fP\fIfrow\fP\fB, int \fP\fIfcol\fP\fB);\fP
.br
.SH DESCRIPTION
The function \fBset_form_fields\fP changes the field pointer array of
the given \fIform\fP.  The array must be terminated by a \fBNULL\fP.
.PP
The function \fBform_fields\fP returns the field array of the given form.
.PP
The function \fBfield_count\fP returns the count of fields in \fIform\fP.
.PP
The function \fBmove_field\fP moves the given field (which must be disconnected)
to a specified location on the screen.
.SH RETURN VALUE
The function \fBform_fields\fP returns a pointer (which may be \fBNULL\fP).
It does not set \fBerrno\fP.
.PP
The function \fBfield_count\fP returns \fBERR\fP if the \fIform\fP parameter
is \fBNULL\fP.
.PP
The functions \fBset_form_fields\fP and \fBmove_field\fP return one of
the following codes on error:
.TP 5
.B E_OK
The routine succeeded.
.TP 5
.B E_BAD_ARGUMENT
Routine detected an incorrect or out-of-range argument.
.TP 5
.B E_CONNECTED
The field is already connected to a form.
.TP 5
.B E_POSTED
The form is already posted.
.TP 5
.B E_SYSTEM_ERROR
System error occurred (see \fBerrno\fP(3)).
.SH SEE ALSO
\fBcurses\fP(3X), \fBform\fP(3X).
.SH NOTES
The header file \fB<form.h>\fP automatically includes the header file
\fB<curses.h>\fP.
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines emulate the System V forms library.
They were not supported on
Version 7 or BSD versions.
.PP
The SVr4 forms library documentation specifies the \fBfield_count\fP error value
as \-1 (which is the value of \fBERR\fP).
