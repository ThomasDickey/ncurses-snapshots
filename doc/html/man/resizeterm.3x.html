</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       This is an extension to the curses library.  It provides callers with a
       hook  into  the  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  data  to resize windows, primarily for use by
       programs running in  an  X  Window  terminal  (e.g.,  xterm)  when  the
       terminal's screen size is changed by the user:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Curses  windows  cannot extend outside the screen.  If the terminal
           is shrunk, curses windows must be shrunk to fit.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the terminal is stretched, rows and/or columns can be  added  to
           existing  windows.   The  added  cells  should  match  the  current
           attributes of the windows.

       If the calling program has not set up a handler for  <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>  when  it
       initializes  <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG>  (e.g.,  using  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">initscr(3x)</A></STRONG>  or <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">newterm(3x)</A></STRONG>), then
       <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> sets a handler for <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG> which notifies the library  when  a
       window-size   event   has   occurred.   The  library  checks  for  this
       notification

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   when reading input data,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   when implicitly resuming program mode (e.g., between <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">endwin(3x)</A></STRONG> and
           <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">wrefresh(3x)</A></STRONG>), and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   when explicitly resuming program mode in <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">restartterm(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       When the library has found that the terminal's window-size has changed,
       it calls <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> to update its data structures.

       An application which establishes its  own  <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>  handler  can  call
       <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG>,  but  in  that case, the library will not see <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>, and
       proper layout will rely upon the application.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-FUNCTIONS">FUNCTIONS</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-resizeterm">resizeterm</a></H3><PRE>
       The function <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> resizes the standard and current windows (i.e.,
       <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>curscr</STRONG>)  to  the  specified  dimensions, and adjusts other
       bookkeeping data used by the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> library  that  record  the  window
       dimensions such as the <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and <STRONG>COLS</STRONG> variables.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-resize_term">resize_term</a></H3><PRE>
       Most  of  the  work  for  <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG>  is  done  by  the  inner function
       <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG>.  The outer function <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> adds  bookkeeping  for  the
       <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>  handler,  as  well  as  repainting  the  soft-key  area  (see
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">slk_touch(3x)</A></STRONG>).

       The <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG> function attempts to resize all  windows.   This  helps
       with simple applications.  However:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   It is not possible to automatically resize pads.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Applications  which  have  complicated  layouts  should  check  for
           <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> returned from <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>, and  adjust  their  layout,  e.g.,
           using <STRONG>wresize</STRONG> and <STRONG>mvwin</STRONG>, or by recreating the windows.

       When  resizing  windows,  <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG>  recursively  adjusts subwindows,
       keeping them within the updated parent window's limits.  If a top-level
       window  happens  to extend to the screen's limits, then on resizing the
       window, <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG> will keep the window extending to the corresponding
       limit, regardless of whether the screen has shrunk or grown.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-is_term_resized">is_term_resized</a></H3><PRE>
       A support function <STRONG>is_term_resized</STRONG> is provided so that applications can
       check if the <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG> function would modify the  window  structures.
       It returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> if the windows would be modified, and <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> otherwise.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       Except  as  noted,  these functions return the integer <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> upon failure
       and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on success.  They will fail if either of the dimensions are less
       than  or  equal  to  zero,  or  if an error occurs while (re)allocating
       memory for the windows.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-NOTES">NOTES</a></H2><PRE>
       While these functions are intended to  be  used  to  support  a  signal
       handler  (i.e.,  for  <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>), care should be taken to avoid invoking
       them in a context where <STRONG>malloc</STRONG> or <STRONG>realloc</STRONG> may  have  been  interrupted,
       since it uses those functions.

       If ncurses is configured to supply its own <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG> handler,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   on receipt of a <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>, the handler sets a flag

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   which is tested in <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">wgetch(3x)</A></STRONG>, <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">doupdate(3x)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">restartterm(3x)</A></STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   in turn, calling the <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> function,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   which <STRONG>ungetch</STRONG>'s a <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> which will be read on the next call to
           <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG>.

           The <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG> alerts an  application  that  the  screen  size  has
           changed,  and  that it should repaint special features such as pads
           that cannot be done automatically.

           Calling <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> or <STRONG>resize_term</STRONG> directly from a signal handler is
           unsafe.   This  indirect  method  is  used to provide a safe way to
           resize the ncurses data structures.

       If the environment variables <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> or <STRONG>COLUMNS</STRONG> are set,  this  overrides
       the  library's  use  of  the  window  size  obtained from the operating
       system.  Thus, even if a <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG> is received, no  screen  size  change
       may be recorded.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       It is possible to resize the screen with SVr4 curses, by

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   exiting curses with <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">endwin(3x)</A></STRONG> and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   resuming using <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       Doing that clears the screen and is visually distracting.

       This  extension  of ncurses was introduced in mid-1995.  It was adopted
       in NetBSD curses (2001) and PDCurses (2003).
