       term - compiled <EM>terminfo</EM> terminal description


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG><A HREF="tic.1m.html">tic(1)</A></STRONG> compiles a <EM>terminfo</EM> terminal type description, and <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>
       reads it.  A compiled description may be stored  in  a  file  or  in  a
       database  of, potentially, many such descriptions.  Further, a compiled
       description may be in one of two formats: one similar to that  used  by
       System V,  and  a  newer,  extensible  format  employed  exclusively by
       <EM>ncurses</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Storage-Location">Storage Location</a></H3><PRE>
       Compiled  <EM>terminfo</EM>  <EM>descriptions</EM>  <EM>are</EM>  <EM>placed</EM>   under   the   directory
       <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>.   One  of  two  configurations  is  selected  when
       building the <EM>ncurses</EM> libraries.

       <STRONG>directory</STRONG> <STRONG>tree</STRONG>
            A two-level scheme is used to avoid a linear search of a huge Unix
            system  directory:  <EM>/usr/share/terminfo/</EM>c<EM>/</EM>name  where  <EM>name</EM> is the
            name of the terminal, and <EM>c</EM> is the first character of <EM>name</EM>.  Thus,
            the  compiled  description of terminal type "act4" is found in the
            file <EM>/usr/share/terminfo/a/act4</EM>.  Synonyms for the  same  terminal
            are implemented by multiple links to the same compiled file.

       <STRONG>hashed</STRONG> <STRONG>database</STRONG>
            Using  the Berkeley database API, two types of records are stored:
            the <EM>terminfo</EM> data in the same format as that stored in a directory
            tree  with  the terminal's primary type name as a key, and records
            containing only aliases pointing to the primary name.

            If built to write hashed databases, <EM>ncurses</EM> can still  read  <EM>term-</EM>
            <EM>info</EM>  databases  organized  as  a directory tree, but cannot write
            entries into the  directory  tree.   It  can  write  (or  rewrite)
            entries in the hashed database.

            <EM>ncurses</EM>   distinguishes   the   two  cases  in  the  <EM>TERMINFO</EM>  and
            <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM> environment variable by assuming  a  directory  tree
            for entries that correspond to an existing directory, and a hashed
            database otherwise.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Legacy-Storage-Format">Legacy Storage Format</a></H3><PRE>
       The format has been chosen so that it will be the same on all hardware.
       A  byte  of  at  least eight bits' width is assumed, but no assumptions
       about bit ordering or sign extension are made.

       The file is divided into six parts:

            (a) <EM>header</EM>,

            (b) <EM>terminal</EM> <EM>names</EM>,

            (c) <EM>Boolean</EM> <EM>flags</EM>,

            (d) <EM>numbers</EM>,

            (e) <EM>strings</EM>, and

            (f) a <EM>string</EM> <EM>table</EM>.

       The <EM>header</EM> section begins the file.  This section  contains  six  short
       integers in the format described below.  These integers are

            (1) the <EM>magic</EM> <EM>number</EM>
                 (octal 0432);

            (2) the size,
                 in bytes, of the <EM>terminal</EM> <EM>names</EM> section;

            (3) the number of bytes in the <EM>Boolean</EM> <EM>flags</EM> section;

            (4) the number of short integers in the <EM>numbers</EM> section;

            (5) the number of offsets
                 (short integers) in the <EM>strings</EM> section;

            (6) the size,
                 in bytes, of the <EM>string</EM> <EM>table</EM>.

       The  capabilities  in  the <EM>Boolean</EM> <EM>flags</EM>, <EM>numbers</EM>, and <EM>strings</EM> sections
       are in the same order as in the header file <EM>term.h</EM>.

       Short integers are signed, in the range -32768 to 32767, and stored  in
       little-endian format.

       Numbers  in  a  terminal  description,  whether they are entries in the
       <EM>numbers</EM> or <EM>strings</EM> table, are positive  integers.   Boolean  flags  are
       treated  as  positive  one-byte integers.  In each case, those positive
       integers represent a terminal capability.  The  terminal  compiler  <EM>tic</EM>
       uses  negative  integers  to handle the cases where a capability is not
       available:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If a capability is absent from this terminal, <EM>tic</EM> stores  a  -1  in
           the corresponding table.

           The integer value -1 is represented by two bytes 0377, 0377.
           Absent Boolean values are represented by the byte 0 (false).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  a capability has been canceled from this terminal, <EM>tic</EM> stores a
           -2 in the corresponding table.

           The integer value -2 is represented by two bytes 0377, 0376.
           The Boolean value -2 is represented by the byte 0376.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Other negative values are illegal.

       The <EM>terminal</EM> <EM>names</EM> section comes after the  <EM>header</EM>.   It  contains  the
       first  line  of the <EM>terminfo</EM> description, listing the various names for
       the terminal, separated by  the  "|"  character.   The  <EM>terminal</EM>  <EM>names</EM>
       section is terminated with an ASCII NUL character.

       The  <EM>Boolean</EM>  <EM>flags</EM>  section  has  one  byte  for  each  flag.  Boolean
       capabilities are either 1 or 0 (true or false) according to whether the
       terminal supports the given capability or not.

       Between  the  <EM>Boolean</EM> <EM>flags</EM> section and the <EM>number</EM> section, a null byte
       will be inserted, if necessary,  to  ensure  that  the  <EM>number</EM>  section
       begins  on  an even byte This is a relic of the PDP-11's word-addressed
       architecture, originally designed to avoid traps induced by  addressing
       a  word  on  an odd byte boundary.  All short integers are aligned on a
       short word boundary.

       The <EM>numbers</EM> section is similar to  the  <EM>Boolean</EM>  <EM>flags</EM>  section.   Each
       capability  takes  up two bytes, and is stored as a little-endian short
       integer.

       The <EM>strings</EM> section is also similar.  Each capability is  stored  as  a
       short integer.  The capability value is an index into the <EM>string</EM> <EM>table</EM>.

       The <EM>string</EM> <EM>table</EM> is the last section.  It contains all of the values of
       string capabilities referenced in the <EM>strings</EM> section.  Each string  is
       null-terminated.  Special characters in ^X or \c notation are stored in
       their interpreted  form,  not  the  printing  representation.   Padding
       information  <STRONG>$&lt;</STRONG><EM>nn</EM><STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>  and  parameter  information <STRONG>%x</STRONG> are stored intact in
       uninterpreted form.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Extended-Storage-Format">Extended Storage Format</a></H3><PRE>
       The previous section describes the conventional <EM>terminfo</EM> binary format.
       With  some  minor variations of the offsets (see PORTABILITY), the same
       binary format is used in all modern Unix systems.  Each system  uses  a
       predefined set of Boolean, number or string capabilities.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> libraries and applications support extended <EM>terminfo</EM> binary
       format, allowing users  to  define  capabilities  that  are  loaded  at
       runtime.   This  extension  is made possible by using the fact that the
       other implementations stop reading the <EM>terminfo</EM> data  when  they  reach
       the  end of the size given in the header.  <EM>ncurses</EM> checks the size, and
       if it exceeds that due to  the  predefined  data,  continues  to  parse
       according to its own scheme.

       First, it reads the extended header (5 short integers):

            (1)  count of extended Boolean capabilities

            (2)  count of extended numeric capabilities

            (3)  count of extended string capabilities

            (4)  count of the items in extended string table

            (5)  size of the extended string table in bytes

       The  count-  and  size-values for the extended string table include the
       extended capability <EM>names</EM> as well as extended capability <EM>values</EM>.

       Using the counts and sizes, <EM>ncurses</EM> allocates arrays and reads data for
       the extended capabilities in the same order as the header information.

       The  extended  string  table  contains  values for string capabilities.
       After the end of these values, it contains the names for  each  of  the
       extended capabilities in order: Boolean, numeric, and string.

       By  storing  terminal  descriptions  in  this  way,  <EM>ncurses</EM> is able to
       provide  a  database  useful  with  legacy  applications,  as  well  as
       providing  data  for applications that require more information about a
       terminal type than was anticipated by X/Open Curses.  See  <STRONG><A HREF="user_caps.5.html">user_caps(5)</A></STRONG>
       for an overview of the way <EM>ncurses</EM> uses this extended information.

       Applications  that  manipulate  terminal  data  can use the definitions
       described in <STRONG><A HREF="term_variables.3x.html">term_variables(3x)</A></STRONG> associating the long  capability  names
       with members of a <EM>TERMTYPE</EM> structure.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Extended-Number-Format">Extended Number Format</a></H3><PRE>
       On  occasion, 16-bit signed integers are not large enough.  <EM>ncurses</EM> 6.1
       introduced a new format by making a few changes to the legacy format:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a different magic number (octal 01036)

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   changing the type for the <EM>number</EM> array from signed 16-bit  integers
           to signed 32-bit integers.

       To   maintain   compatibility,  the  library  presents  the  same  data
       structures to direct users of the <EM>TERMTYPE</EM>  structure  as  in  previous
       formats.   However,  that  cannot  provide  callers  with  the extended
       numbers.   The  library  uses  a  similar  but  hidden  data  structure
       <EM>TERMTYPE2</EM> to provide data for the <EM>terminfo</EM> functions.

</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-setupterm">setupterm</a></H3><PRE>
       Note  that  it  is  possible for <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> to expect a different set of
       capabilities than  are  actually  present  in  the  file.   Either  the
       database   may   have  been  updated  since  <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG>  was  recompiled
       (resulting in extra unrecognized entries in the file)  or  the  program
       may  have  been  recompiled more recently than the database was updated
       (resulting in missing entries).  The routine <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> must be prepared
       for  both  possibilities  -  this  is  why  the  numbers  and sizes are
       included.  Also, new capabilities must always be added at  the  end  of
       the lists of Boolean, number, and string capabilities.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Binary-Format">Binary Format</a></H3><PRE>
       X/Open  Curses  does  not  specify  a format for the <EM>terminfo</EM> database.
       System V <EM>curses</EM> used a directory-tree of binary files, one per terminal
       description.

       Despite  the  consistent use of little-endian numbers and the otherwise
       self-describing format, it is not  wise  to  count  on  portability  of
       binary  <EM>terminfo</EM> entries between commercial Unix versions.  The problem
       is that there are at least three versions  of  <EM>terminfo</EM>  (under  HP-UX,
       AIX,  and  OSF/1)  each  of which diverged from System V <EM>terminfo</EM> after
       SVr1, and added extension capabilities to the string table that (in the
       binary format) collide with System V and X/Open Curses extensions.  See
       <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG> for detailed discussion of  <EM>terminfo</EM>  source  compatibility
       issues.

       This  implementation  is by default compatible with the binary <EM>terminfo</EM>
       format used by Solaris <EM>curses</EM>, except in a few less-used details  where
       it  was  found that the latter did not match X/Open Curses.  The format
       used by the other Unix versions can be matched by building <EM>ncurses</EM> with
       different configuration options.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Magic-Codes">Magic Codes</a></H3><PRE>
       The  magic  number  in a binary <EM>terminfo</EM> file is the first 16 bits (two
       bytes).  Besides making it more reliable for the library to check  that
       a  file  is  <EM>terminfo</EM>,  utilities such as <STRONG>file(1)</STRONG> also use that to tell
       what the file-format is.  System V defined more than one magic  number,
       with 0433, 0435 as screen-dumps (see <STRONG><A HREF="scr_dump.5.html">scr_dump(5)</A></STRONG>).  This implementation
       uses 01036 as a continuation of that sequence,  but  with  a  different
       high-order byte to avoid confusion.

   <STRONG>The</STRONG> <EM>TERMTYPE</EM> <STRONG>Structure</STRONG>
       Direct  access  to  the  <EM>TERMTYPE</EM>  structure  is  provided  for  legacy
       applications.   Portable  applications  should  use  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tigetflag(3x)</A></STRONG>  and
       related functions to read terminal capabilities.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Mixed-case-Terminal-Names">Mixed-case Terminal Names</a></H3><PRE>
       A  small  number  of  terminal descriptions use uppercase characters in
       their names.  If the underlying  file  system  ignores  the  difference
       between   uppercase   and  lowercase,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  represents  the  "first
       character" of the terminal name used as the  intermediate  level  of  a
       directory tree in (two-character) hexadecimal form.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Limits">Limits</a></H3><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM> stores compiled terminal descriptions in three related formats,
       described in the subsections

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>Legacy</STRONG> <STRONG>Storage</STRONG> <STRONG>Format</STRONG>, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>Extended</STRONG> <STRONG>Storage</STRONG> <STRONG>Format</STRONG>, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>Extended</STRONG> <STRONG>Number</STRONG> <STRONG>Format</STRONG>.

       The legacy storage format and the extended number format differ by  the
       types  of  numeric  capability  that  they  can store (for example, 16-
       versus 32-bit integers).  The extended  storage  format  introduced  by
       <EM>ncurses</EM> 5.0 adds data to either of these formats.

       Some limitations apply:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   total  compiled  entries  cannot  exceed  4096  bytes in the legacy
           format.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   total compiled entries cannot exceed 32768 bytes  in  the  extended
           format.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the name field cannot exceed 128 bytes.

       Compiled  entries  are  limited to 32768 bytes because offsets into the
       <EM>strings</EM> <EM>table</EM> use two-byte integers.   The  legacy  format  could  have
       supported  32768-byte  entries,  but  was  limited  to a virtual memory
       page's 4096 bytes.
