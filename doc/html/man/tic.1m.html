       [<STRONG>-R</STRONG> <EM>subset</EM>] [<STRONG>-v</STRONG>[<EM>n</EM>]] [<STRONG>-w</STRONG>[<EM>n</EM>]] <EM>file</EM>


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>tic</STRONG> translates a <EM>terminfo</EM> file from source  format  into  the  compiled
       format used by the <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG> library.

       As  described  in  <STRONG><A HREF="term.5.html">term(5)</A></STRONG>, the database may be either a directory tree
       (one file per terminal entry) or a  hashed  database  (one  record  per
       entry).   The  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  command writes only one type of entry, depending on
       how it was built.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   For   directory   trees,   the   top-level   directory,   such   as
           <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>, specifies the location of the database.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   For  hashed  databases, a filename is needed.  If the given file is
           not found by that name, but can  be  found  by  adding  the  suffix
           ".db", then that is used.

           The default name for the hashed database is the same as the default
           directory name (only adding a ".db" suffix).

       In either case (directory or hashed  database),  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  will  create  the
       container  if  it  does  not exist.  For a directory, this would be the
       "terminfo" leaf, versus a <EM>terminfo.db</EM> file.

       The results  are  normally  placed  in  the  system  <EM>terminfo</EM>  database
       <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>.   The  compiled terminal description can be placed
       in a different <EM>terminfo</EM> database.  There are two ways to achieve this:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   First, you may override the system default either by using  the  <STRONG>-o</STRONG>
           option,  or  by  setting  the  variable  <EM>TERMINFO</EM>  in  the  process
           environment to a valid database location.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Secondly,  if  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  cannot  write  in  <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>  or  the
           location  specified  using your <EM>TERMINFO</EM> variable, it looks for the
           directory <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM> (or hashed database  <EM>$HOME/.terminfo.db</EM>);
           if that location exists, the entry is placed there.

       Libraries   that  read  <EM>terminfo</EM>  entries  are  expected  to  check  in
       succession

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a location specified by the <EM>TERMINFO</EM> environment variable,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   directories listed in the <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM> environment variable,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a compiled-in list of directories (<EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>), and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the system <EM>terminfo</EM> database (<EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>).

       Section "Fetching  Compiled  Descriptions"  in  <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>  goes  into
       further detail.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Aliases">Aliases</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  is  the same program as <STRONG>infotocap</STRONG> and <STRONG>captoinfo</STRONG>; usually those are
       linked to, or copied from, this program.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   When invoked as <STRONG>infotocap</STRONG>, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> sets the <STRONG>-I</STRONG> option.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   When invoked as <STRONG>captoinfo</STRONG>, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> sets the <STRONG>-C</STRONG> option.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>-0</STRONG>     restricts the output to a single line.

       <STRONG>-1</STRONG>     restricts the output to a single column.

       <STRONG>-a</STRONG>     tells <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  to  retain  commented-out  capabilities  rather  than
              discarding  them.   Capabilities are commented by prefixing them
              with a period.  <STRONG>-a</STRONG> implies <STRONG>-x</STRONG>, because <STRONG>tic</STRONG> treats the commented-
              out  entries as user-defined names.  If the source is in <EM>termcap</EM>
              format, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> accepts the 2-character names required by version 6.
              Otherwise these are ignored.

       <STRONG>-C</STRONG>     Force  source  translation to <EM>termcap</EM> format.  Note: this option
              differs from the <STRONG>-C</STRONG> option of <STRONG><A HREF="infocmp.1m.html">infocmp(1m)</A></STRONG> in that  it  does  not
              merely  translate capability names, but also translates <EM>terminfo</EM>
              string  capability  values  to  <EM>termcap</EM>  format.    <STRONG>tic</STRONG>   leaves
              capabilities  that are not translatable in the entry under their
              <EM>terminfo</EM> names, but commented out with two preceding dots.   The
              actual  format  used  incorporates some improvements for escaped
              characters from <EM>terminfo</EM> format.  For a stricter  BSD-compatible
              translation, specify <STRONG>-K</STRONG> as well.

              If  <STRONG>-C</STRONG>  is  combined  with  <STRONG>-c</STRONG>,  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  makes  additional  checks,
              reporting cases where <EM>terminfo</EM> capability values do not have  an
              exact equivalent in <EM>termcap</EM> syntax.  For example:

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>sgr</STRONG>  usually  does not convert, because <EM>termcap</EM> is unable to
                  work with more than two parameters, and because  <EM>termcap</EM>  <EM>'s</EM>
                  language  for encoding parameterized capabilities lacks many
                  of <EM>terminfo</EM>'s arithmetic and logical operators.

       <STRONG>-c</STRONG>     tells <STRONG>tic</STRONG> to perform only validation of <EM>file</EM> <EM>,</EM> including  syntax
              problems  and  invalid  "<STRONG>use</STRONG>" references; no output is produced.
              If you specify <STRONG>-C</STRONG> (<STRONG>-I</STRONG>) with this option, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> warns about entries
              that,  after "<STRONG>use</STRONG>" resolution, exceed 1023 (4096) bytes.  Due to
              a fixed buffer length in older <EM>termcap</EM>  libraries,  as  well  as
              buggy  checking  of the buffer length (and a documented limit in
              <EM>terminfo</EM>),  these  entries  may  cause  core  dumps  with  other
              implementations.

              <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  checks  string  capabilities  to  ensure  that  those  with
              parameters are valid expressions.  It  validates  only  standard
              string capabilities, ignoring those defined with the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option.

       <STRONG>-D</STRONG>     tells  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  to print the database locations that it knows about,
              and exit.  The first location shown is the one to which it would
              write  compiled  terminal  descriptions.   If <STRONG>tic</STRONG> is not able to
              find  a  writable  database  location  according  to  the  rules
              summarized  above,  it  will print a diagnostic and exit with an
              error rather than printing a list of database locations.

       <STRONG>-e</STRONG> <EM>list</EM>
              Limit writes and translations to  the  comma-separated  <EM>list</EM>  of
              terminal  types.  If any name or alias of a terminal matches one
              of the  names  in  the  list,  the  entry  will  be  written  or
              translated as normal.  Otherwise no output will be generated for
              it.  The option value is interpreted as a  file  containing  the
              list  if  it  contains  a  '/'.  (Note: depending on how <STRONG>tic</STRONG> was
              compiled, this option may require <STRONG>-I</STRONG> or <STRONG>-C</STRONG>.)

       <STRONG>-f</STRONG>     Display    complex    terminfo     strings     which     contain
              if/then/else/endif expressions indented for readability.

       <STRONG>-G</STRONG>     Display  constant  literals  in  decimal  form rather than their
              character equivalents.

       <STRONG>-g</STRONG>     Display constant character literals in quoted form  rather  than
              their decimal equivalents.

       <STRONG>-I</STRONG>     Force source translation to terminfo format.

       <STRONG>-K</STRONG>     Suppress some longstanding <EM>ncurses</EM> extensions to termcap format,
              e.g., "\s" for space.

       <STRONG>-L</STRONG>     Force source translation to terminfo format  using  the  long  C
              variable names listed in &lt;<STRONG>term.h</STRONG>&gt;

       <STRONG>-N</STRONG>     Disable smart defaults.  Normally, when translating from termcap
              to terminfo, the compiler makes a number  of  assumptions  about
              the    defaults    of    string    capabilities   <STRONG>reset1_string</STRONG>,
              <STRONG>carriage_return</STRONG>, <STRONG>cursor_left</STRONG>, <STRONG>cursor_down</STRONG>, <STRONG>scroll_forward</STRONG>,  <STRONG>tab</STRONG>,
              <STRONG>newline</STRONG>, <STRONG>key_backspace</STRONG>, <STRONG>key_left</STRONG>, and <STRONG>key_down</STRONG>, then attempts to
              use obsolete termcap capabilities to deduce correct values.   It
              also normally suppresses output of obsolete termcap capabilities
              such as <STRONG>bs</STRONG>.  This option forces a more literal translation  that
              also preserves the obsolete capabilities.

       <STRONG>-o</STRONG><EM>dir</EM>  Write  compiled  entries  to given database location.  Overrides
              the <EM>TERMINFO</EM> environment variable.

       <STRONG>-Q</STRONG><EM>n</EM>    Rather than show source in terminfo  (text)  format,  print  the
              compiled   (binary)   format  in  hexadecimal  or  base64  form,
              depending on the option's value:

               1  hexadecimal

               2  base64

               3  hexadecimal and base64

       <STRONG>-q</STRONG>     Suppress  comments  and  blank  lines  when  showing  translated
              source.

       <STRONG>-R</STRONG><EM>subset</EM>
              Restrict  output to a given subset.  This option is for use with
              archaic versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or  HP-
              UX that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo;
              and outright broken ports like  AIX  3.x  that  have  their  own
              extensions incompatible with SVr4/XSI.

              Available subsets are
              "SVr1", "Ultrix", "HP", "BSD", and "AIX"

              See <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG> for details.

       <STRONG>-r</STRONG>     Force   entry   resolution   (so   there  are  no  remaining  tc
              capabilities) even when doing  translation  to  termcap  format.
              This  may  be  needed  if you are preparing a termcap file for a
              termcap library (such as GNU termcap through version 1.3 or  BSD
              termcap  through  4.3BSD)  that  does  not  handle  multiple  tc
              capabilities per entry.

       <STRONG>-s</STRONG>     Summarize the compile by  showing  the  database  location  into
              which  entries  are written, and the number of entries which are
              compiled.

       <STRONG>-T</STRONG>     eliminates size-restrictions on the  generated  text.   This  is
              mainly  useful  for  testing  and  analysis,  since the compiled
              descriptions are limited  (e.g.,  1023  for  termcap,  4096  for
              terminfo).

       <STRONG>-t</STRONG>     tells  <STRONG>tic</STRONG> to discard commented-out capabilities.  Normally when
              translating   from   terminfo   to    termcap,    untranslatable
              capabilities are commented-out.

       <STRONG>-U</STRONG>     tells  <STRONG>tic</STRONG> to not post-process the data after parsing the source
              file.  Normally, it infers data which  is  commonly  missing  in
              older terminfo data, or in termcaps.

       <STRONG>-V</STRONG>     reports  the  version of <EM>ncurses</EM> which was used in this program,
              and exits.

       <STRONG>-v</STRONG><EM>n</EM>    specifies that (verbose) output be  written  to  standard  error
              trace information showing <STRONG>tic</STRONG>'s progress.

              The  optional  parameter  <EM>n</EM>  is a number from 1 to 9, inclusive,
              indicating the desired level of detail of information.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If <EM>ncurses</EM> is built without tracing  support,  the  optional
                  parameter is ignored.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If <EM>n</EM> is omitted, the default level is 1.

              <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If <EM>n</EM> is specified and greater than 1, the level of detail is
                  increased,  and  the  output  is   written   (with   tracing
                  information) to the "trace" file.

              The debug flag levels are as follows:

              1   Names of files created and linked

              2   Information related to the "use" facility

              3   Statistics from the hashing algorithm

              4   Details of extended capabilities

              5   (unused)

              6   (unused)

              7   Entries into the string-table

              8   List of tokens encountered by scanner

              9   All values computed in construction of the hash table

       <STRONG>-W</STRONG>     By  itself,  the  <STRONG>-w</STRONG>  option  will  not force long strings to be
              wrapped.  Use the <STRONG>-W</STRONG> option to do this.

              If you specify both <STRONG>-f</STRONG> and <STRONG>-W</STRONG> options,  the  latter  is  ignored
              when <STRONG>-f</STRONG> has already split the line.

       <STRONG>-w</STRONG><EM>n</EM>    specifies  the  width of the output.  The parameter is optional.
              If it is omitted, it defaults to 60.

       <STRONG>-x</STRONG>     Treat unknown capabilities as user-defined  (see  <STRONG><A HREF="user_caps.5.html">user_caps(5)</A></STRONG>).
              That  is,  if  you  supply  a capability name which <STRONG>tic</STRONG> does not
              recognize, it will infer its type (Boolean,  number  or  string)
              from  the  syntax  and  make  an  extended table entry for that.
              User-defined capability strings whose name begins with  "k"  are
              treated as function keys.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Parameters">Parameters</a></H3><PRE>
       <EM>file</EM>   contains  one  or  more <EM>terminfo</EM> terminal descriptions in source
              format; see <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>.  Each description in the file describes
              the capabilities of a particular terminal type.

              If  <EM>file</EM>  is  "-",  the  data  are  read from the standard input
              stream.  The <EM>file</EM> parameter may also be the path of a  character
              device.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Processing">Processing</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>  documents  all  but  one of the capabilities recognized by
       <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.  The exception is the <STRONG>use</STRONG> capability,  which  enables  a  terminal
       type description to incorporate others by reference.

       <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  serially  reads  and  compiles  terminal type descriptions; at any
       given time, the program compiles at most one <EM>current</EM> entry.   When  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>
       encounters  a  <STRONG>use=</STRONG><EM>entry-name</EM>  field in the current entry, it reads the
       compiled description of <EM>entry-name</EM> from <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM> to complete
       the current entry.  If <STRONG>tic</STRONG> has already compiled a description of <EM>entry-</EM>
       <EM>name</EM> preceding the current entry in <EM>file</EM>, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> uses  it  preferentially.
       <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  duplicates  the  capabilities in <EM>entry-name</EM> for the current entry,
       excepting  those  that  the  current  entry  explicitly  defines.   The
       foregoing  has  implications for capability cancellation.  When <EM>entry-1</EM>
       declares "<STRONG>use=</STRONG><EM>entry-2</EM>", any canceled capabilities in <EM>entry-2</EM> must  also
       appear  in  <EM>entry-1</EM> prior to "<STRONG>use=</STRONG><EM>entry-2</EM>" for these capabilities to be
       canceled in <EM>entry-1</EM>.

       Compiled entries cannot exceed 4096 bytes in the legacy storage format,
       or  32768  using  the  extended  number  format.  The name field cannot
       exceed 512 bytes.  Terminal names exceeding the  maximum  alias  length
       (32 characters on systems with long filenames, 14 characters otherwise)
       will be truncated to the maximum alias length  and  a  warning  message
       will be printed.

       There  is  some  evidence  that  historic  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  implementations treated
       description fields with no whitespace in them as additional aliases  or
       short  names.   This  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  does  not  do  that,  but  it does warn when
       description fields may be treated that way and check them for dangerous
       characters.

       Unlike  the  SVr4 <STRONG>tic</STRONG> command, this implementation can actually compile
       termcap sources.  In fact, entries in terminfo and termcap  syntax  can
       be  mixed  in  a  single  source file.  See <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG> for the list of
       termcap names taken to be equivalent to terminfo names.

       The SVr4 manual pages are not clear on the  resolution  rules  for  <STRONG>use</STRONG>
       capabilities.   <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  <STRONG>tic</STRONG> finds <STRONG>use</STRONG> targets anywhere in the source
       file, or anywhere in the file  tree  rooted  at  the  location  in  the
       <EM>TERMINFO</EM>  environment  variable  (if  <EM>TERMINFO</EM>  is  defined), or in the
       user's <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM> database (if it exists), or  (finally)  anywhere
       in the system's collection of compiled entries.

       The  error  messages  from this <STRONG>tic</STRONG> have the same format as GNU C error
       messages, and can be parsed by GNU Emacs's compile facility.

       Aside from <STRONG>-c</STRONG> and <STRONG>-v</STRONG>, options are not portable:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Most of <STRONG>tic</STRONG>'s options are not supported by SVr4 <STRONG>tic</STRONG>:

           <STRONG>-0</STRONG> <STRONG>-1</STRONG> <STRONG>-C</STRONG> <STRONG>-G</STRONG> <STRONG>-I</STRONG> <STRONG>-N</STRONG> <STRONG>-R</STRONG> <STRONG>-T</STRONG> <STRONG>-V</STRONG> <STRONG>-a</STRONG> <STRONG>-e</STRONG> <STRONG>-f</STRONG> <STRONG>-g</STRONG> <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <STRONG>-r</STRONG> <STRONG>-s</STRONG> <STRONG>-t</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG>

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The NetBSD <STRONG>tic</STRONG> supports a few of the <EM>ncurses</EM> options

           <STRONG>-a</STRONG> <STRONG>-o</STRONG> <STRONG>-x</STRONG>

           and adds <STRONG>-S</STRONG> (a feature which does the same thing  as  <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG>'s  <STRONG>-e</STRONG>
           and <STRONG>-E</STRONG> options).

       The SVr4 <STRONG>-c</STRONG> mode does not report bad "use=" links.

       System  V  does  not  compile  entries  to  or  read  entries from your
       <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM> database unless <EM>TERMINFO</EM> is explicitly set to it.

       X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) provides a brief description of  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.   It
       lists  one  option:  <STRONG>-c</STRONG>.  The omission of <STRONG>-v</STRONG> is unexpected.  The change
       history states that the description is derived from  Tru64.   According
       to its manual pages, that system also supported the <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option.

       Shortly  after  Issue 7  was  released,  Tru64 was discontinued.  As of
       2019, the surviving implementations of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> are  SVr4  (AIX,  HP-UX  and
       Solaris), <EM>ncurses</EM> and NetBSD curses.  The SVr4 <STRONG>tic</STRONG> programs all support
       the <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option.  The NetBSD <STRONG>tic</STRONG> program follows X/Open's  documentation,
       omitting the <STRONG>-v</STRONG> option.

       The  X/Open  rationale  states  that  some  implementations of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> read
       terminal descriptions from the standard input if the <EM>file</EM> parameter  is
       omitted.   None of these implementations do that.  Further, it comments
       that some  may  choose  to  read  from  "./terminfo.src"  but  that  is
       obsolescent  behavior  from SVr2, and is not (for example) a documented
       feature of SVr3.

       System V Release 2 provided  a  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  utility.   It  accepted  a  single
       option:  <STRONG>-v</STRONG>  (optionally  followed  by  a  number).   According to Ross
       Ridge's comment in <EM>mytinfo</EM>, this version of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> was unable to represent
       canceled capabilities.

       System  V  Release 3 provided a different <STRONG>tic</STRONG> utility, written by Pavel
       Curtis, (originally named "compile" in <EM>pcurses</EM>).  This added an  option
       <STRONG>-c</STRONG>  to check the file for errors, with the caveat that errors in "use="
       links would not be reported.  System  V  Release  3  documented  a  few
       warning  messages  which  did not appear in <EM>pcurses</EM>.  While the program
       itself was changed  little  as  development  continued  with  System  V
       Release  4,  the  table  of capabilities grew from 180 (<EM>pcurses</EM>) to 464
       (Solaris).

       In early development of <EM>ncurses</EM> (1993), Zeyd Ben-Halim used  the  table
       from  <EM>mytinfo</EM>  to  extend  the  <EM>pcurses</EM>  table to 469 capabilities (456
       matched SVr4, 8 were only in SVr4, 13 were not in SVr4).  Of those  13,
       11  were  ultimately  discarded  (perhaps  to match the draft of X/Open
       Curses).  The exceptions were <STRONG>memory_lock_above</STRONG> and <STRONG>memory_unlock</STRONG>  (see
       <STRONG><A HREF="user_caps.5.html">user_caps(5)</A></STRONG>).

       Eric  Raymond  incorporated  parts of <EM>mytinfo</EM> into <EM>ncurses</EM> to implement
       the termcap-to-terminfo source conversion, and extended that  to  begin
       development of the corresponding terminfo-to-termcap source conversion,
       Thomas Dickey completed that development over  the  course  of  several
       years.

       In  1999,  Thomas  Dickey  added  the <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option to support user-defined
       capabilities.

       In 2010, Roy Marples provided a <STRONG>tic</STRONG> program and  terminfo  library  for
       NetBSD.   That  implementation  adapts  several  features from <EM>ncurses</EM>,
       including <STRONG>tic</STRONG>'s <STRONG>-x</STRONG> option.

       The <STRONG>-c</STRONG> option tells <STRONG>tic</STRONG> to check for problems in  the  terminfo  source
       file.  Continued development provides additional checks:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>pcurses</EM> had 8 warnings.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM> in 1996 had 16 warnings.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Solaris (SVr4) <EM>curses</EM> has 28 warnings.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD <EM>tic</EM> in 2019 has 19 warnings.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM> in 2019 has 96 warnings.

       The  checking  done  in  <EM>ncurses</EM>'s  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  helps  with  the conversion to
       termcap, as well as pointing out errors  and  inconsistencies.   It  is
       also  used  to  ensure  consistency with the user-defined capabilities.
       There are 527 distinct capabilities in <EM>ncurses</EM>'s terminal database; 128
       of those are user-defined.
