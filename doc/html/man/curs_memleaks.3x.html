</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       These  functions  are  used to simplify analysis of memory leaks in the
       <EM>ncurses</EM> library.

       Any implementation of curses must not free the memory associated with a
       screen, since (even after calling <STRONG><A HREF="curs_initscr.3x.html">endwin(3x)</A></STRONG>), it must be available for
       use in the next call to <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG>.  There are also chunks  of  memory
       held  for  performance  reasons.   That makes it hard to analyze curses
       applications for memory leaks.  When  using  the  specially  configured
       debugging  version  of  the  <EM>ncurses</EM>  library,  applications  can  call
       functions which free those chunks of memory, simplifying the process of
       memory-leak checking.

       Some of the functions are named with a "_nc_" prefix because  they  are
       not intended for use in the non-debugging library:

       <STRONG>_nc_freeall</STRONG>
            This frees (almost) all of the memory allocated by <EM>ncurses</EM>.

       <STRONG>_nc_free_and_exit</STRONG>
            This frees the memory allocated by <EM>ncurses</EM> (like <STRONG>_nc_freeall</STRONG>), and
            exits the program.  It is preferred over <STRONG>_nc_freeall</STRONG> since some of
            that  memory  may  be  required  to  keep the application running.
            Simply exiting (with the given exit-code) is safer.

       <STRONG>_nc_free_tinfo</STRONG>
            Use this function if only the low-level  terminfo  functions  (and
            corresponding library) are used.  Like <STRONG>_nc_free_and_exit</STRONG>, it exits
            the program after freeing memory.

       The  functions  prefixed "_nc" are normally not available; they must be
       configured into the library at build  time  using  the  <STRONG>--disable-leaks</STRONG>
       option.   That  compiles-in  code that frees memory that normally would
       not be freed.

       The <STRONG>exit_curses</STRONG> and <STRONG>exit_terminfo</STRONG> functions call <STRONG>_nc_free_and_exit</STRONG>  and
       <STRONG>_nc_free_tinfo</STRONG>  if  the  library  is  configured to support memory-leak
       checking.  If the library is  not  configured  to  support  memory-leak
       checking, they simply call <STRONG>exit</STRONG>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       These functions do not return a value.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       These   functions   are  not  part  of  X/Open  Curses;  nor  do  other
       implementations of curses provide a similar feature.

       In any implementation of X/Open Curses, an application can free part of
       the memory allocated by curses:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The portable part of <STRONG>exit_curses</STRONG>  can  be  freed  using  <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>,
           passing the <EM>SCREEN</EM> pointer returned by <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.

           In  some implementations, there is a global variable <STRONG>sp</STRONG> which could
           be used, e.g., if the screen were only initialized using <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The portable part of <STRONG>exit_terminfo</STRONG> can be freed using <STRONG>del_curterm</STRONG>.

           In this case, there is a global variable <STRONG>cur_term</STRONG> which can be used
           as parameter.
