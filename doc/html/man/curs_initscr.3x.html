</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-initscr">initscr</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> determines the terminal  type  and  initializes  the  library's
       <EM>SCREEN</EM>,  <EM>WINDOW</EM>,  and  other data structures.  It is normally the first
       <EM>curses</EM> function call a program performs.  However, an application  with
       unusual needs might employ a few other <EM>curses</EM> functions beforehand:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_slk.3x.html">slk_init(3x)</A></STRONG> to set up soft-label keys;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">filter(3x)</A></STRONG>  if  the  program  is  designed  to operate in a process
           pipeline;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">ripoffline(3x)</A></STRONG> to reserve up to five lines at the top and/or bottom
           of  the  screen  from  management  by  <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>,  the standard <EM>curses</EM>
           window; and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">use_env(3x)</A></STRONG> and/or <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">use_tioctl(3x)</A></STRONG> to configure use of  the  process
           environment  and  operating system's terminal driver, respectively,
           when determining the dimensions of the terminal display.

       Further, a <EM>curses</EM> program might call <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> prior  to  or  instead  of
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> in two specialized cases described in its subsection below.

       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  causes  the  first  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG>  call to clear the screen.  If
       errors occur, <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> writes an appropriate diagnostic message  to  the
       standard  error  stream  and  exits; otherwise, it returns a pointer to
       <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-newterm">newterm</a></H3><PRE>
       An application that manages multiple terminals should call <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> once
       for each such device <EM>instead</EM> of <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>.  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>'s arguments are

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the  <EM>type</EM>  of  the  associated  terminal,  or  <EM>NULL</EM> to use the <EM>TERM</EM>
           environment variable;

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   an output stream <EM>outf</EM> connected to the terminal; and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   an input stream <EM>inf</EM>  connected  to  the  terminal.   It  returns  a
           variable  of  structure  type  <EM>SCREEN</EM>  <STRONG>*</STRONG>, which should be saved for
           later use with <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> and <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> passes the file descriptor of the output stream to the <EM>terminfo</EM>
       function <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>, which returns a pointer to a <EM>TERMINAL</EM> structure
       that <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> stores in the <EM>SCREEN</EM> it returns to the application.

       An application that needs to inspect a terminal type's capabilities, so
       that  it  can  continue  to run in a line-oriented mode if the terminal
       cannot support a screen-oriented program, would also use  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.   If
       at most one terminal connection is needed, the programmer could perform
       such a capability test, decide which mode in  which  to  operate,  then
       call  <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>  on  the  pointer returned by <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>, and proceed with
       either <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or a non-<EM>curses</EM> interface.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-endwin">endwin</a></H3><PRE>
       The program must also call <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> for each terminal being  used  before
       exiting  from <EM>curses</EM>.  If <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> is called more than once for the same
       terminal, the first terminal referred to must be the last one for which
       <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> is called.

       A  program  should always call <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> before exiting the application or
       temporarily suspending <EM>curses</EM>'s management of the terminal.  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   resets colors to correspond with the default color pair 0,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   moves the cursor to the lower left-hand corner of the screen,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   clears the remainder of the  line  so  that  it  uses  the  default
           colors,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   sets the cursor to normal visibility (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">curs_set(3x)</A></STRONG>),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   if  applicable, stops cursor-addressing mode using the <STRONG>exit_ca_mode</STRONG>
           (<STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>) terminal capability, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   restores terminal modes (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">reset_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>).

       Calling <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG> or <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">doupdate(3x)</A></STRONG> after  a  temporary  escape  causes
       <EM>curses</EM> to resume managing the terminal.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-isendwin">isendwin</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>isendwin</STRONG>  returns <STRONG>TRUE</STRONG> if <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> has been called without any subsequent
       calls to <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">wrefresh(3x)</A></STRONG>, and <STRONG>FALSE</STRONG> otherwise.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-set_term">set_term</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> re-orients the <EM>curses</EM> library's operations to another terminal
       when the application has arranged to manage more than one with <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.
       <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> expects a <EM>SCREEN</EM> pointer previously returned by <STRONG>newterm</STRONG> as  an
       argument,  and  returns  the previous one.  <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> is the only <EM>curses</EM>
       API function that manipulates <EM>SCREEN</EM> pointers; all others  affect  only
       the current terminal.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-delscreen">delscreen</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>  frees  the  storage  backing  the  supplied  <EM>SCREEN</EM>  pointer
       argument.  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> does not, so that an application can resume  managing
       a  terminal  with  <EM>curses</EM>  after  a (possibly conditional or temporary)
       suspension; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">curs_kernel(3x)</A></STRONG>.  Call <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> after  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  when  a
       particular <EM>SCREEN</EM> structure is no longer needed.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG> on success and <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> on failure.

       In <EM>ncurses</EM>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG> if

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the terminal was not initialized,

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> is called more than once without updating the screen, or

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">reset_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG> returns <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>  returns  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  if it cannot allocate storage for the <EM>SCREEN</EM>
           data structure or the top-level windows  thereof:  <STRONG>curscr</STRONG>,  <STRONG>newscr</STRONG>,
           and <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>.

       Functions  that  return  pointers  return  <EM>NULL</EM>  on error.  In <EM>ncurses</EM>,
       <STRONG>set_term</STRONG> does not fail.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       X/Open Curses, Issue 4 describes  these  functions.   It  specifies  no
       error conditions for them.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Differences">Differences</a></H3><PRE>
       X/Open  Curses  specifies  that  portable  applications  must  not call
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> more than once:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The portable way to use <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> is once only, using <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG>  to
           restore the screen after <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   This implementation allows using <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> after <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>.

       Old versions of curses, e.g., BSD 4.4, would return a null pointer from
       <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> when an error is detected, rather than exiting.  It is safe but
       redundant to check the return value of <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> in X/Open Curses.

       Calling  <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  does not dispose of the memory allocated in <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or
       <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.  Deleting a <EM>SCREEN</EM> provides a way to do this:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses does not say what happens to <EM>WINDOW</EM>s  when  <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG>
           "frees  storage  associated  with  the  <EM>SCREEN</EM>"  nor  does the SVr4
           documentation help, adding that it should be called after <STRONG>endwin</STRONG> if
           a <EM>SCREEN</EM> is no longer needed.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   However,  <EM>WINDOW</EM>s are implicitly associated with a <EM>SCREEN</EM>.  so that
           it is reasonable to expect <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> to deal with these.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4 curses deletes  the  standard  <EM>WINDOW</EM>  structures  <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>  and
           <STRONG>curscr</STRONG>  as  well  as a work area <STRONG>newscr</STRONG>.  SVr4 curses ignores other
           windows.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Since version 4.0 (1996), <EM>ncurses</EM> has  maintained  a  list  of  all
           windows  for  each  screen,  using that information to delete those
           windows when <STRONG>delscreen</STRONG> is called.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD copied this feature of <EM>ncurses</EM> in  2001.   PDCurses  follows
           the SVr4 model, deleting only the standard <EM>WINDOW</EM> structures.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-High-level-versus-Low-level">High-level versus Low-level</a></H3><PRE>
       Different  implementations  may  disagree  regarding  the level of some
       functions.  For example, <EM>SCREEN</EM>  (returned  by  <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>)  and  <EM>TERMINAL</EM>
       (returned  by  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>)  hold  file  descriptors  for  the output
       stream.  If an application switches screens using <STRONG>set_term</STRONG>, or switches
       terminals using <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">set_curterm(3x)</A></STRONG>, applications which use the output file
       descriptor can have different behavior  depending  on  which  structure
       holds the corresponding descriptor.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD's   <EM>baudrate</EM>  function  uses  the  descriptor  in  <EM>TERMINAL</EM>.
           <EM>ncurses</EM> and SVr4 <EM>curses</EM> use the descriptor in <EM>SCREEN</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   NetBSD and <EM>ncurses</EM> use the descriptor in <EM>TERMINAL</EM> for terminal  I/O
           modes,  e.g.,  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">def_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>,  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">def_prog_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>.  SVr4 curses
           uses the descriptor in <EM>SCREEN</EM>.

   <STRONG>Unset</STRONG> <STRONG><EM>TERM</EM></STRONG> <STRONG>Variable</STRONG>
       If the <EM>TERM</EM> variable is  missing  or  empty,  <STRONG>initscr</STRONG>  uses  the  value
       "unknown",  which  normally  corresponds  to  a terminal entry with the
       <STRONG>generic</STRONG> (<STRONG>gn</STRONG>) capability.  Generic entries are detected by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>
       and  cannot  be  used for full-screen operation.  Other implementations
       may handle a missing/empty <EM>TERM</EM> variable differently.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Signal-Handlers">Signal Handlers</a></H3><PRE>
       Quoting from X/Open Curses Issue 7, section 3.1.1:

            Curses implementations may provide for  special  handling  of  the
            SIGINT,  SIGQUIT,  and  SIGTSTP  signals  if  their disposition is
            SIG_DFL at the time <EM>initscr</EM> is called...

            Any special handling for these signals may remain  in  effect  for
            the  life  of  the  process  or  until  the  process  changes  the
            disposition of the signal.

            None of the Curses functions are required to be safe with  respect
            to signals...

       This  implementation establishes signal handlers during initialization,
       e.g., <STRONG>initscr</STRONG> or <STRONG>newterm</STRONG>.  Applications which must handle these signals
       should  set  up  the  corresponding  handlers  <EM>after</EM>  initializing  the
       library:

       <STRONG>SIGINT</STRONG>
            The handler <EM>attempts</EM> to clean up the screen on exit.  Although  it
            <EM>usually</EM> works as expected, there are limitations:

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Walking  the  <EM>SCREEN</EM> list is unsafe, since all list management
                is done without any signal blocking.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On systems which  have  <STRONG>REENTRANT</STRONG>  turned  on,  <STRONG>set_term</STRONG>  uses
                functions which could deadlock or misbehave in other ways.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>endwin</STRONG>  calls  other  functions, many of which use <STRONG>stdio(3)</STRONG> or
                other library functions which are clearly unsafe.

       <STRONG>SIGTERM</STRONG>
            This uses the same handler as <STRONG>SIGINT</STRONG>, with the  same  limitations.
            It  is  not  mentioned  in X/Open Curses, but is more suitable for
            this purpose than <STRONG>SIGQUIT</STRONG> (which is used in debugging).

       <STRONG>SIGTSTP</STRONG>
            This handles the <EM>stop</EM> signal, used in job control.  When  resuming
            the  process,  this  implementation  discards  pending  input with
            <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">flushinp(3x)</A></STRONG>, and repaints the screen assuming that  it  has  been
            completely altered.  It also updates the saved terminal modes with
            <STRONG><A HREF="curs_kernel.3x.html">def_shell_mode(3x)</A></STRONG>.

       <STRONG>SIGWINCH</STRONG>
            This handles the window-size changes which  were  ignored  in  the
            standardization   efforts.    The  handler  sets  a  (signal-safe)
            variable that is later tested by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_getch.3x.html">wgetch(3x)</A></STRONG> and <STRONG><A HREF="curs_get_wch.3x.html">wget_wch(3x)</A></STRONG>.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>wgetch</STRONG> returns the key code <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG>.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>wget_wch</STRONG> returns <STRONG>KEY_CODE_YES</STRONG> and sets its  <EM>wch</EM>  parameter  to
                <STRONG>KEY_RESIZE</STRONG>.

            At  the same time, <EM>ncurses</EM> calls <STRONG>resizeterm</STRONG> to adjust the standard
            screen <STRONG>stdscr</STRONG>, and update other data such as <STRONG>LINES</STRONG> and <STRONG>COLS</STRONG>.
