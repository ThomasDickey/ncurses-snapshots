</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-tset----initialization"><EM>tset</EM> -- initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       This program initializes terminals.

       First,  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  retrieves  the  current  terminal  mode settings for your
       terminal.  It does this by successively testing

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the standard error,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   standard output,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   standard input and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   ultimately "/dev/tty"

       to obtain terminal settings.  Having  retrieved  these  settings,  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>
       remembers which file descriptor to use when updating settings.

       Next,  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  determines  the type of terminal that you are using.  This
       determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type found.

       1. The <STRONG>terminal</STRONG> argument specified on the command line.

       2. The value of the <EM>TERM</EM> environment variable.

       3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with  the  standard
       error  output  device  in  the  <EM>/etc/ttys</EM> file.  (On System V hosts and
       systems using that convention, <STRONG>getty(8)</STRONG> does this job by  setting  <EM>TERM</EM>
       according to the type passed to it by <EM>/etc/inittab</EM>.)

       4.  The  default  terminal  type, "unknown", is not suitable for curses
       applications.

       If the terminal type was not specified  on  the  command-line,  the  <STRONG>-m</STRONG>
       option  mappings  are  then  applied;  see  subsection  "Terminal  Type
       Mapping".  Then, if the terminal  type  begins  with  a  question  mark
       ("?"),  the user is prompted for confirmation of the terminal type.  An
       empty response confirms the type, or, another type can  be  entered  to
       specify  a  new  type.  Once the terminal type has been determined, the
       terminal description for the terminal is  retrieved.   If  no  terminal
       description  is  found  for  the type, the user is prompted for another
       terminal type.

       Once the terminal description is retrieved,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   if the "<STRONG>-w</STRONG>" option is  enabled,  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  may  update  the  terminal's
           window size.

           If  the  window  size cannot be obtained from the operating system,
           but the terminal  description  (or  environment,  e.g.,  <EM>LINES</EM>  and
           <EM>COLUMNS</EM>  variables  specify  this),  use  this to set the operating
           system's notion of the window size.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   if the "<STRONG>-c</STRONG>" option is enabled, the backspace,  interrupt  and  line
           kill characters (among many other things) are set

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   unless   the   "<STRONG>-I</STRONG>"   option  is  enabled,  the  terminal  and  tab
           <EM>initialization</EM> strings are sent to the standard error output,  and,
           if  the  terminal device does not appear to be a pseudoterminal (as
           might be used by a  terminal  emulator  program),  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  waits  one
           second in case a hardware reset was issued.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Finally,  if  the  erase,  interrupt  and line kill characters have
           changed, or are not set to their default values, their  values  are
           displayed to the standard error output.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-reset----reinitialization"><EM>reset</EM> -- reinitialization</a></H3><PRE>
       When invoked as <STRONG>reset</STRONG>, <STRONG>tset</STRONG> sets the terminal modes to "sane" values:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   sets canonical ("cooked") and echo modes,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   turns off cbreak and raw modes,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   turns on newline translation and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   resets special input characters to their default values

       before doing the terminal initialization described above.  Also, rather
       than  using  the  terminal <EM>initialization</EM> strings, it uses the terminal
       <EM>reset</EM> strings.

       The <STRONG>reset</STRONG> command is useful after a program dies leaving a terminal  in
       an abnormal state:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   you may have to type

               <EM>&lt;LF&gt;</EM><STRONG>reset</STRONG><EM>&lt;LF&gt;</EM>

           (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the terminal
           to  work,  as  carriage-return  may  no longer work in the abnormal
           state.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Setting-the-Environment">Setting the Environment</a></H3><PRE>
       It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information  about
       the terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment.  This is done
       using the <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option.

       When  the <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option is specified, the commands to enter the information
       into the shell's environment are written to the  standard  output.   If
       the  <EM>SHELL</EM>  environment  variable  ends  in "csh", the commands are for
       <STRONG>csh(1)</STRONG>, otherwise, they are for <STRONG>sh(1)</STRONG>.  The <EM>csh</EM> commands set and  unset
       the shell variable <STRONG>noglob</STRONG>, leaving it unset.  The following line in the
       <STRONG>.login</STRONG> or <STRONG>.profile</STRONG> files will initialize the environment correctly:

           eval `tset -s options ... `


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Terminal-Type-Mapping">Terminal Type Mapping</a></H3><PRE>
       When  the  terminal  is  not  hardwired into the system (or the current
       system information is incorrect) the terminal  type  derived  from  the
       <EM>/etc/ttys</EM>  file  or  the  <EM>TERM</EM>  environment variable is often something
       generic like <STRONG>network</STRONG>, <STRONG>dialup</STRONG>, or <STRONG>unknown</STRONG>.   When  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  is  used  in  a
       startup  script  it is often desirable to provide information about the
       type of terminal used on such ports.

       The <STRONG>-m</STRONG> options maps from some set of conditions  to  a  terminal  type,
       that is, to tell <STRONG>tset</STRONG> "If I'm on this port at a particular speed, guess
       that I'm on that kind of terminal".

       The  argument  to  the  <STRONG>-m</STRONG> option consists of an optional port type, an
       optional operator, an optional baud  rate  specification,  an  optional
       colon  (":")  character and a terminal type.  The port type is a string
       (delimited by  either  the  operator  or  the  colon  character).   The
       operator  may  be  any combination of "&gt;", "&lt;", "@", and "!"; "&gt;" means
       greater than, "&lt;" means less than, "@" means equal to and  "!"  inverts
       the  sense  of the test.  The baud rate is specified as a number and is
       compared with the speed of the standard error output (which  should  be
       the control terminal).  The terminal type is a string.

       If  the  terminal  type  is  not  specified on the command line, the <STRONG>-m</STRONG>
       mappings are applied to the terminal type.  If the port type  and  baud
       rate  match  the  mapping,  the  terminal type specified in the mapping
       replaces the current type.  If more than one mapping is specified,  the
       first applicable mapping is used.

       For  example,  consider  the following mapping: <STRONG>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</STRONG>.  The
       port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate specification is
       9600, and the terminal type is vt100.  The result of this mapping is to
       specify that if the terminal type is  <STRONG>dialup</STRONG>,  and  the  baud  rate  is
       greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type of <STRONG>vt100</STRONG> will be used.

       If  no  baud  rate  is specified, the terminal type will match any baud
       rate.  If no port type is specified, the terminal type will  match  any
       port  type.   For  example,  <STRONG>-m</STRONG>  <STRONG>dialup:vt100</STRONG> <STRONG>-m</STRONG> <STRONG>:?xterm</STRONG> will cause any
       dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100,
       and any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm.   Note,
       because  of  the  leading  question mark, the user will be queried on a
       default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.

       No whitespace characters are  permitted  in  the  <STRONG>-m</STRONG>  option  argument.
       Also,  to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that the
       entire <STRONG>-m</STRONG> option argument be placed within single quote characters, and
       that  <EM>csh</EM>  users  insert  a  backslash  character  ("\")   before   any
       exclamation marks ("!").


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       The options are as follows:

       <STRONG>-c</STRONG>   Set control characters and modes.

       <STRONG>-e</STRONG> <EM>ch</EM>
            Set the erase character to <EM>ch</EM>.

       <STRONG>-I</STRONG>   Do  not  send  the  terminal  or tab initialization strings to the
            terminal.

       <STRONG>-i</STRONG> <EM>ch</EM>
            Set the interrupt character to <EM>ch</EM>.

       <STRONG>-k</STRONG> <EM>ch</EM>
            Set the line kill character to <EM>ch</EM>.

       <STRONG>-m</STRONG> <EM>mapping</EM>
            Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal;  see  subsection
            "Terminal Type Mapping".

       <STRONG>-Q</STRONG>   Do  not  display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill
            characters.   Normally  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  displays  the  values  for   control
            characters which differ from the system's default values.

       <STRONG>-q</STRONG>   The  terminal  type  is  displayed to the standard output, and the
            terminal is not initialized in any way.  The option "-" by  itself
            is equivalent but archaic.

       <STRONG>-r</STRONG>   Print the terminal type to the standard error output.

       <STRONG>-s</STRONG>   Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the environment
            variable  <EM>TERM</EM> to the standard output; see subsection "Setting the
            Environment".

       <STRONG>-V</STRONG>   reports the version of <EM>ncurses</EM> which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       <STRONG>-w</STRONG>   Resize the window to match the  size  deduced  via  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>.
            Normally  this  has  no  effect,  unless  <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> is not able to
            detect the window size.

       The arguments for the <STRONG>-e</STRONG>, <STRONG>-i</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-k</STRONG> options may either be  entered  as
       actual  characters  or by using the "hat" notation, i.e., control-h may
       be specified as "^H" or "^h".

       If neither <STRONG>-c</STRONG> or <STRONG>-w</STRONG> is given, both options are assumed.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></H2><PRE>
       The <STRONG>tset</STRONG> command uses these environment variables:

       <EM>SHELL</EM>
            tells <STRONG>tset</STRONG> whether  to  initialize  <EM>TERM</EM>  using  <STRONG>sh(1)</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>csh(1)</STRONG>
            syntax.

       <EM>TERM</EM> Denotes  your  terminal  type.   Each  terminal  type is distinct,
            though many are similar.

       <EM>TERMCAP</EM>
            may denote the location of a termcap database.  If it  is  not  an
            absolute  pathname,  e.g.,  begins  with  a  "/", <STRONG>tset</STRONG> removes the
            variable from the environment  before  looking  for  the  terminal
            description.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-FILES">FILES</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>/etc/ttys</EM>
              system port name to terminal type mapping database (BSD versions
              only).

       <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>
              compiled terminal description database directory


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       Neither  IEEE  Std  1003.1/The  Open  Group Base Specifications Issue 7
       (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <STRONG>tset</STRONG> or <STRONG>reset</STRONG>.

       The AT&amp;T <STRONG>tput</STRONG> utility (AIX, HP-UX, Solaris) incorporated the  terminal-
       mode  manipulation  as well as termcap-based features such as resetting
       tabstops from <STRONG>tset</STRONG> in BSD (4.1c),  presumably  with  the  intention  of
       making  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  obsolete.   However, each of those systems still provides
       <STRONG>tset</STRONG>.  In fact, the commonly-used <STRONG>reset</STRONG> utility is always an alias  for
       <STRONG>tset</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>tset</STRONG> utility provides backward compatibility with BSD environments;
       under  most  modern  Unices,  <EM>/etc/inittab</EM>  and  <STRONG>getty(8)</STRONG>  can set <EM>TERM</EM>
       appropriately for each dial-up line, obviating  what  was  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>'s  most
       important  use.   This  implementation behaves like 4.4BSD <STRONG>tset</STRONG>, with a
       few exceptions we shall consider now.

       A few options are different because the <EM>TERMCAP</EM> variable is  no  longer
       supported under terminfo-based <EM>ncurses</EM>:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  <STRONG>-S</STRONG>  option  of  BSD  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  no longer works; it prints an error
           message to the standard error and dies.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The <STRONG>-s</STRONG> option only sets <EM>TERM</EM>, not <EM>TERMCAP</EM>.

       There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking <STRONG>tset</STRONG> via a  link
       named  "TSET"  (or  via  any  other  name  beginning with an upper-case
       letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only.  This feature has been
       omitted.

       The <STRONG>-A</STRONG>, <STRONG>-E</STRONG>, <STRONG>-h</STRONG>, <STRONG>-u</STRONG> and <STRONG>-v</STRONG> options were deleted from the <STRONG>tset</STRONG> utility in
       4.4BSD.  None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of  limited
       utility  at  best.   The  <STRONG>-a</STRONG>,  <STRONG>-d</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>-p</STRONG>  options  are similarly not
       documented or useful, but  were  retained  as  they  appear  to  be  in
       widespread  use.   It  is  strongly recommended that any usage of these
       three options be changed to use the <STRONG>-m</STRONG> option instead.  The <STRONG>-a</STRONG>, <STRONG>-d</STRONG>, and
       <STRONG>-p</STRONG> options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above.

       Very old systems, e.g., 3BSD, used a different  terminal  driver  which
       was  replaced  in  4BSD in the early 1980s.  To accommodate these older
       systems, the 4BSD <STRONG>tset</STRONG> provided a <STRONG>-n</STRONG> option to  specify  that  the  new
       terminal  driver  should be used.  This implementation does not provide
       that choice.

       It is still permissible to specify the <STRONG>-e</STRONG>, <STRONG>-i</STRONG>, and <STRONG>-k</STRONG>  options  without
       arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage be fixed
       to explicitly specify the character.

       As  of 4.4BSD, executing <STRONG>tset</STRONG> as <STRONG>reset</STRONG> no longer implies the <STRONG>-Q</STRONG> option.
       Also, the interaction between the - option and the <EM>terminal</EM> argument in
       some historic implementations of <STRONG>tset</STRONG> has been removed.

       The <STRONG>-c</STRONG> and  <STRONG>-w</STRONG>  options  are  not  found  in  earlier  implementations.
       However, a different window size-change feature was provided in 4.4BSD.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   In  4.4BSD,  <STRONG>tset</STRONG> uses the window size from the termcap description
           to set the window size if <STRONG>tset</STRONG> is not able  to  obtain  the  window
           size from the operating system.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   In <EM>ncurses</EM>, <STRONG>tset</STRONG> obtains the window size using <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>, which
           may be from the operating system, the <EM>LINES</EM> and <EM>COLUMNS</EM> environment
           variables or the terminal description.

       Obtaining  the window size from a terminal's type description is common
       to  both  implementations,  but  considered  obsolescent.    Its   only
       practical  use  is  for hardware terminals.  Generally, the window size
       will remain uninitialized only if there were a  problem  obtaining  the
       value  from the operating system (and <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> would still fail).  The
       <EM>LINES</EM> and <EM>COLUMNS</EM> environment variables may thus be useful for  working
       around  window-size  problems, but have the drawback that if the window
       is resized, their  values  must  be  recomputed  and  reassigned.   The
       <STRONG>resize(1)</STRONG> program distributed with <STRONG>xterm(1)</STRONG> assists this activity.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       A  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  command written by Kurt Shoens appeared in 1BSD (March 1978).
       It  set  the  <EM>erase</EM>  and  <EM>kill</EM>  characters  to  <STRONG>^H</STRONG>  (backspace)  and  <STRONG>@</STRONG>
       respectively.   Mark Horton improved this <STRONG>reset</STRONG> in 3BSD (October 1979),
       adding <EM>intr</EM>, <EM>quit</EM>, <EM>start</EM>/<EM>stop</EM>, and <EM>eof</EM> characters as well  as  changing
       the  program  to  avoid  modifying  any user settings.  That version of
       <STRONG>reset</STRONG> did not use <EM>termcap</EM>.

       Eric Allman wrote a distinct <STRONG>tset</STRONG> command for 1BSD, using a  forerunner
       of  <EM>termcap</EM>  called  <EM>ttycap</EM>.   Allman's  comments  in  the  source code
       indicate that he began work in  October  1977,  continuing  development
       over  the next few years.  By late 1979, it had migrated to <EM>termcap</EM> and
       handled the <EM>TERMCAP</EM> variable.  Later comments indicate  that  <STRONG>tset</STRONG>  was
       modified  in  September  1980 to use logic copied from the 3BSD "reset"
       program when it  was  invoked  as  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>.   This  version  appeared  in
       4.1cBSD,  late  in 1982.  Other developers such as Keith Bostic and Jim
       Bloom continued to modify <STRONG>tset</STRONG> until 4.4BSD was released in 1993.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD  sources
       to use the <EM>terminfo</EM> API by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.
