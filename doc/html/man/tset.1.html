</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-tset---initialization">tset - initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       This program initializes terminals.

       First,  <B>tset</B>  retrieves  the  current  terminal  mode settings for your
       terminal.  It does this by successively testing

       <B>o</B>   the standard error,

       <B>o</B>   standard output,

       <B>o</B>   standard input and

       <B>o</B>   ultimately "/dev/tty"

       to obtain terminal settings.  Having  retrieved  these  settings,  <B>tset</B>
       remembers which file descriptor to use when updating settings.

       Next,  <B>tset</B>  determines  the type of terminal that you are using.  This
       determination is done as follows, using the first terminal type found.

       1. The <B>terminal</B> argument specified on the command line.

       2. The value of the <B>TERM</B> environmental variable.

       3. (BSD systems only.) The terminal type associated with  the  standard
       error  output  device  in the <I>/etc/ttys</I> file.  (On System-V-like UNIXes
       and systems using that convention, <I>getty</I> does this job by setting  <B>TERM</B>
       according to the type passed to it by <I>/etc/inittab</I>.)

       4. The default terminal type, "unknown".

       If  the  terminal  type  was  not specified on the command-line, the <B>-m</B>
       option mappings are then applied (see the section <B>TERMINAL</B> <B>TYPE</B> <B>MAPPING</B>
       for  more  information).   Then,  if  the  terminal  type begins with a
       question mark ("?"), the user  is  prompted  for  confirmation  of  the
       terminal  type.   An empty response confirms the type, or, another type
       can be entered to specify a new type.  Once the terminal type has  been
       determined, the terminal description for the terminal is retrieved.  If
       no terminal description is found for the type, the user is prompted for
       another terminal type.

       Once the terminal description is retrieved,

       <B>o</B>   if  the  "<B>-w</B>"  option  is  enabled,  <B>tset</B> may update the terminal's
           window size.

           If the window size cannot be obtained from  the  operating  system,
           but  the  terminal  description  (or  environment,  e.g., <B>LINES</B> and
           <B>COLUMNS</B> variables specify this), use  this  to  set  the  operating
           system's notion of the window size.

       <B>o</B>   if  the  "<B>-c</B>"  option is enabled, the backspace, interrupt and line
           kill characters (among many other things) are set

       <B>o</B>   unless  the  "<B>-I</B>"  option  is  enabled,  the   terminal   and   tab
           <I>initialization</I>  strings  are sent to the standard error output, and
           <B>tset</B> waits one second (in case a hardware reset was issued).

       <B>o</B>   Finally, if the erase, interrupt  and  line  kill  characters  have
           changed,  or  are not set to their default values, their values are
           displayed to the standard error output.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-reset---reinitialization">reset - reinitialization</a></H3><PRE>
       When invoked as <B>reset</B>, <B>tset</B> sets the terminal modes to "sane" values:

       <B>o</B>   sets cooked and echo modes,

       <B>o</B>   turns off cbreak and raw modes,

       <B>o</B>   turns on newline translation and

       <B>o</B>   resets any unset special characters to their default values

       before doing the terminal initialization described above.  Also, rather
       than  using  the  terminal <I>initialization</I> strings, it uses the terminal
       <I>reset</I> strings.

       The <B>reset</B> command is useful after a program dies leaving a terminal  in
       an abnormal state:

       <B>o</B>   you may have to type

               <I>&lt;LF&gt;</I><B>reset</B><I>&lt;LF&gt;</I>

           (the line-feed character is normally control-J) to get the terminal
           to work, as carriage-return may no  longer  work  in  the  abnormal
           state.

       <B>o</B>   Also, the terminal will often not echo the command.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       The options are as follows:

       <B>-c</B>   Set control characters and modes.

       <B>-e</B>   Set the erase character to <I>ch</I>.

       <B>-I</B>   Do  not  send  the  terminal  or tab initialization strings to the
            terminal.

       <B>-i</B>   Set the interrupt character to <I>ch</I>.

       <B>-k</B>   Set the line kill character to <I>ch</I>.

       <B>-m</B>   Specify a mapping from a port type to a terminal.  See the section
            <B>TERMINAL</B> <B>TYPE</B> <B>MAPPING</B> for more information.

       <B>-Q</B>   Do  not  display any values for the erase, interrupt and line kill
            characters.   Normally  <B>tset</B>  displays  the  values  for   control
            characters which differ from the system's default values.

       <B>-q</B>   The  terminal  type  is  displayed to the standard output, and the
            terminal is not initialized in any way.  The option "-" by  itself
            is equivalent but archaic.

       <B>-r</B>   Print the terminal type to the standard error output.

       <B>-s</B>   Print the sequence of shell commands to initialize the environment
            variable <B>TERM</B> to the standard output.  See the section <B>SETTING</B> <B>THE</B>
            <B>ENVIRONMENT</B> for details.

       <B>-V</B>   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       <B>-w</B>   Resize the window to match the  size  deduced  via  <B><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3X.html">setupterm(3X)</A></B>.
            Normally  this  has  no  effect,  unless  <B>setupterm</B> is not able to
            detect the window size.

       The arguments for the <B>-e</B>, <B>-i</B>, and <B>-k</B> options may either be  entered  as
       actual  characters  or by using the "hat" notation, i.e., control-h may
       be specified as "^H" or "^h".

       If neither <B>-c</B> or <B>-w</B> is given, both options are assumed.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-SETTING-THE-ENVIRONMENT">SETTING THE ENVIRONMENT</a></H2><PRE>
       It is often desirable to enter the terminal type and information  about
       the terminal's capabilities into the shell's environment.  This is done
       using the <B>-s</B> option.

       When the <B>-s</B> option is specified, the commands to enter the  information
       into  the  shell's  environment are written to the standard output.  If
       the <B>SHELL</B> environmental variable ends in "csh", the  commands  are  for
       <B>csh</B>,  otherwise, they are for <B>sh</B>.  Note, the <B>csh</B> commands set and unset
       the shell variable <B>noglob</B>, leaving it unset.  The following line in the
       <B>.login</B> or <B>.profile</B> files will initialize the environment correctly:

           eval `tset -s options ... `


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-TERMINAL-TYPE-MAPPING">TERMINAL TYPE MAPPING</a></H2><PRE>
       When  the  terminal  is  not  hardwired into the system (or the current
       system information is incorrect) the terminal  type  derived  from  the
       <I>/etc/ttys</I>  file  or  the <B>TERM</B> environmental variable is often something
       generic like <B>network</B>, <B>dialup</B>, or <B>unknown</B>.   When  <B>tset</B>  is  used  in  a
       startup  script  it is often desirable to provide information about the
       type of terminal used on such ports.

       The <B>-m</B> options maps from some set of conditions  to  a  terminal  type,
       that is, to tell <B>tset</B> "If I'm on this port at a particular speed, guess
       that I'm on that kind of terminal".

       The argument to the <B>-m</B> option consists of an  optional  port  type,  an
       optional  operator,  an  optional  baud rate specification, an optional
       colon (":") character and a terminal type.  The port type is  a  string
       (delimited  by  either  the  operator  or  the  colon  character).  The
       operator may be any combination of "&gt;", "&lt;", "@", and  "!";  "&gt;"  means
       greater  than,  "&lt;" means less than, "@" means equal to and "!" inverts
       the sense of the test.  The baud rate is specified as a number  and  is
       compared  with  the speed of the standard error output (which should be
       the control terminal).  The terminal type is a string.

       If the terminal type is not specified  on  the  command  line,  the  <B>-m</B>
       mappings  are  applied to the terminal type.  If the port type and baud
       rate match the mapping, the terminal  type  specified  in  the  mapping
       replaces  the current type.  If more than one mapping is specified, the
       first applicable mapping is used.

       For example, consider the following  mapping:  <B>dialup&gt;9600:vt100</B>.   The
       port type is dialup , the operator is &gt;, the baud rate specification is
       9600, and the terminal type is vt100.  The result of this mapping is to
       specify  that  if  the  terminal  type  is <B>dialup</B>, and the baud rate is
       greater than 9600 baud, a terminal type of <B>vt100</B> will be used.

       If no baud rate is specified, the terminal type  will  match  any  baud
       rate.   If  no port type is specified, the terminal type will match any
       port type.  For example, <B>-m</B> <B>dialup:vt100</B>  <B>-m</B>  <B>:?xterm</B>  will  cause  any
       dialup port, regardless of baud rate, to match the terminal type vt100,
       and any non-dialup port type to match the terminal type ?xterm.   Note,
       because  of  the  leading  question mark, the user will be queried on a
       default port as to whether they are actually using an xterm terminal.

       No whitespace characters are  permitted  in  the  <B>-m</B>  option  argument.
       Also,  to avoid problems with meta-characters, it is suggested that the
       entire <B>-m</B> option argument be placed within single quote characters, and
       that   <B>csh</B>   users  insert  a  backslash  character  ("\")  before  any
       exclamation marks ("!").


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       A <B>reset</B> command appeared in 2BSD (April 1979), written by Kurt  Shoens.
       This  program set the <I>erase</I> and <I>kill</I> characters to <B>^H</B> (backspace) and <B>@</B>
       respectively.  Mark Horton improved that in 3BSD (October 1979), adding
       <I>intr</I>,  <I>quit</I>,  <I>start</I>/<I>stop</I>  and  <I>eof</I>  characters  as well as changing the
       program to avoid modifying any user settings.

       Later in 4.1BSD (December 1980), Mark Horton added a call to  the  <B>tset</B>
       program  using  the  <B>-I</B> and <B>-Q</B> options, i.e., using that to improve the
       terminal modes.  With those options, that version of <B>reset</B> did not  use
       the termcap database.

       A separate <B>tset</B> command was provided in 2BSD by Eric Allman.  While the
       oldest published source (from  1979)  provides  both  <B>tset</B>  and  <B>reset</B>,
       Allman's  comments  in the 2BSD source code indicate that he began work
       in October 1977, continuing development over the next few years.

       In September 1980, Eric Allman modified <B>tset</B>, adding the code from  the
       existing  "reset"  feature when <B>tset</B> was invoked as <B>reset</B>.  Rather than
       simply copying the existing program, in this merged version, <B>tset</B>  used
       the  termcap  database  to  do  additional  (re)initialization  of  the
       terminal.  This version appeared in 4.1cBSD, late in 1982.

       Other developers (e.g., Keith Bostic and Jim Bloom) continued to modify
       <B>tset</B> until 4.4BSD was released in 1993.

       The  <B>ncurses</B> implementation was lightly adapted from the 4.4BSD sources
       for a terminfo environment by Eric S. Raymond &lt;esr@snark.thyrsus.com&gt;.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-COMPATIBILITY">COMPATIBILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open  Group  Base  Specifications  Issue  7
       (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents <B>tset</B> or <B>reset</B>.

       The  AT&amp;T  <B>tput</B> utility (AIX, HPUX, Solaris) incorporated the terminal-
       mode manipulation as well as termcap-based features such  as  resetting
       tabstops  from  <B>tset</B>  in  BSD  (4.1c), presumably with the intention of
       making <B>tset</B> obsolete.  However, each of those  systems  still  provides
       <B>tset</B>.   In fact, the commonly-used <B>reset</B> utility is always an alias for
       <B>tset</B>.

       The  <B>tset</B>  utility  provides  for   backward-compatibility   with   BSD
       environments  (under  most modern UNIXes, <B>/etc/inittab</B> and <B>getty(1)</B> can
       set <B>TERM</B> appropriately for each dial-up line; this  obviates  what  was
       <B>tset</B>'s  most  important  use).  This implementation behaves like 4.4BSD
       <B>tset</B>, with a few exceptions specified here.

       A few options are different because the <B>TERMCAP</B> variable is  no  longer
       supported under terminfo-based <B>ncurses</B>:

       <B>o</B>   The  <B>-S</B>  option  of  BSD  <B>tset</B>  no longer works; it prints an error
           message to the standard error and dies.

       <B>o</B>   The <B>-s</B> option only sets <B>TERM</B>, not <B>TERMCAP</B>.

       There was an undocumented 4.4BSD feature that invoking <B>tset</B> via a  link
       named  "TSET"  (or  via  any  other  name  beginning with an upper-case
       letter) set the terminal to use upper-case only.  This feature has been
       omitted.

       The <B>-A</B>, <B>-E</B>, <B>-h</B>, <B>-u</B> and <B>-v</B> options were deleted from the <B>tset</B> utility in
       4.4BSD.  None of them were documented in 4.3BSD and all are of  limited
       utility  at  best.   The  <B>-a</B>,  <B>-d</B>,  and  <B>-p</B>  options  are similarly not
       documented or useful, but  were  retained  as  they  appear  to  be  in
       widespread  use.   It  is  strongly recommended that any usage of these
       three options be changed to use the <B>-m</B> option instead.  The <B>-a</B>, <B>-d</B>, and
       <B>-p</B> options are therefore omitted from the usage summary above.

       Very  old  systems,  e.g., 3BSD, used a different terminal driver which
       was replaced in 4BSD in the early 1980s.  To  accommodate  these  older
       systems,  the  4BSD  <B>tset</B>  provided a <B>-n</B> option to specify that the new
       terminal driver should be used.  This implementation does  not  provide
       that choice.

       It  is  still permissible to specify the <B>-e</B>, <B>-i</B>, and <B>-k</B> options without
       arguments, although it is strongly recommended that such usage be fixed
       to explicitly specify the character.

       As  of 4.4BSD, executing <B>tset</B> as <B>reset</B> no longer implies the <B>-Q</B> option.
       Also, the interaction between the - option and the <I>terminal</I> argument in
       some historic implementations of <B>tset</B> has been removed.

       The  <B>-c</B>  and  <B>-w</B>  options  are  not  found  in earlier implementations.
       However, a different window size-change feature was provided in 4.4BSD.

       <B>o</B>   In 4.4BSD, <B>tset</B> uses the window size from the  termcap  description
           to  set  the  window  size if <B>tset</B> is not able to obtain the window
           size from the operating system.

       <B>o</B>   In ncurses, <B>tset</B> obtains the window size using <B>setupterm</B>, which may
           be  from  the  operating  system, the <B>LINES</B> and <B>COLUMNS</B> environment
           variables or the terminal description.

       Obtaining the window size from the terminal description  is  common  to
       both  implementations,  but considered obsolescent.  Its only practical
       use is for hardware terminals.  Generally speaking, a window size would
       be  unset  only if there were some problem obtaining the value from the
       operating system (and <B>setupterm</B> would still fail).   For  that  reason,
       the  <B>LINES</B>  and <B>COLUMNS</B> environment variables may be useful for working
       around window-size problems.  Those  have  the  drawback  that  if  the
       window  is  resized, those variables must be recomputed and reassigned.
       To do this more easily, use the <B><A HREF="resize.1.html">resize(1)</A></B> program.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-ENVIRONMENT">ENVIRONMENT</a></H2><PRE>
       The <B>tset</B> command uses these environment variables:

       SHELL
            tells <B>tset</B> whether to initialize <B>TERM</B> using <B>sh</B> or <B>csh</B> syntax.

       TERM Denotes your terminal  type.   Each  terminal  type  is  distinct,
            though many are similar.

       TERMCAP
            may  denote  the  location of a termcap database.  If it is not an
            absolute pathname, e.g., begins  with  a  "/",  <B>tset</B>  removes  the
            variable  from  the  environment  before  looking for the terminal
            description.
