       /usr/share/terminfo/*/*


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>Terminfo</EM>  is  a  database describing terminals, used by screen-oriented
       programs  such  as  <STRONG>nvi(1)</STRONG>,  <STRONG>lynx(1)</STRONG>,   <STRONG>mutt(1)</STRONG>,   and   other   curses
       applications,  using  high-level calls to libraries such as <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">curses(3x)</A></STRONG>.
       It is also used via low-level calls by  non-curses  applications  which
       may  be  screen-oriented  (such  as  <STRONG><A HREF="clear.1.html">clear(1)</A></STRONG>)  or  non-screen (such as
       <STRONG><A HREF="tabs.1.html">tabs(1)</A></STRONG>).

       <EM>Terminfo</EM> describes terminals by giving a set of capabilities which they
       have, by specifying how to perform screen operations, and by specifying
       padding requirements and initialization sequences.

       This document describes <EM>ncurses</EM> version 6.5 (patch 20250419).


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-terminfo-Entry-Syntax"><EM>terminfo</EM> Entry Syntax</a></H3><PRE>
       Entries in <EM>terminfo</EM> consist of a sequence of fields:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Each field ends with a comma "," (embedded commas  may  be  escaped
           with a backslash or written as "\054").

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   White space between fields is ignored.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The first field in a <EM>terminfo</EM> entry begins in the first column.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Newlines  and  leading  whitespace (spaces or tabs) may be used for
           formatting entries for readability.  These are removed from  parsed
           entries.

           The  <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG>  <STRONG>-f</STRONG> and <STRONG>-W</STRONG> options rely on this to format if-then-else
           expressions, or  to  enforce  maximum  line-width.   The  resulting
           formatted terminal description can be read by <STRONG>tic</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  first  field for each terminal gives the names which are known
           for the terminal, separated by "|" characters.

           The first name given  is  the  most  common  abbreviation  for  the
           terminal  (its  primary name), the last name given should be a long
           name fully identifying the terminal  (see  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_termattrs.3x.html">longname(3x)</A></STRONG>),  and  all
           others  are  treated as synonyms (aliases) for the primary terminal
           name.

           X/Open Curses advises that all names but  the  last  should  be  in
           lower  case  and  contain no blanks; the last name may well contain
           upper case and blanks for readability.

           This implementation is not so strict; it allows mixed case  in  the
           primary name and aliases.  If the last name has no embedded blanks,
           it allows that to be both an alias and a  verbose  name  (but  will
           warn about this ambiguity).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Lines  beginning  with  a  "#"  in  the first column are treated as
           comments.

           While comment lines are valid at any point, the output of <STRONG>captoinfo</STRONG>
           and  <STRONG>infotocap</STRONG>  (aliases  for <STRONG>tic</STRONG>) will move comments so they occur
           only between entries.

       Terminal names (except for the last, verbose entry)  should  be  chosen
       using  the  following  conventions.   The  particular piece of hardware
       making up the terminal should have a root name,  thus  "hp2621".   This
       name should not contain hyphens.  Modes that the hardware can be in, or
       user preferences, should be indicated by appending a hyphen and a  mode
       suffix.   Thus,  a  vt100  in  132-column  mode  would be vt100-w.  The
       following suffixes should be used where possible:

       <STRONG>Suffix</STRONG>   <STRONG>Example</STRONG>     <STRONG>Meaning</STRONG>
       ------------------------------------------------------------------------
       -<EM>nn</EM>      aaa-60      Number of lines on the screen
       -<EM>n</EM>p      c100-4p     Number of pages of memory
       -am      vt100-am    With automargins (usually the default)
       -m       ansi-m      Mono mode; suppress color
       -mc      wy30-mc     Magic cookie; spaces when highlighting
       -na      c100-na     No arrow keys (leave them in local)
       -nam     vt100-nam   Without automatic margins
       -nl      hp2621-nl   No status line
       -ns      hp2626-ns   No status line
       -rv      c100-rv     Reverse video
       -s       vt100-s     Enable status line
       -vb      wy370-vb    Use visible bell instead of beep
       -w       vt100-w     Wide mode (&gt; 80 columns, usually 132)

       For more on terminal naming conventions, see the <STRONG><A HREF="term.7.html">term(7)</A></STRONG> manual page.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-terminfo-Capabilities-Syntax"><EM>terminfo</EM> Capabilities Syntax</a></H3><PRE>
       The terminfo entry consists of  several  <EM>capabilities</EM>,  i.e.,  features
       that  the  terminal  has,  or  methods  for  exercising  the terminal's
       features.

       After the first field (giving the name(s) of the terminal entry), there
       should be one or more <EM>capability</EM> fields.  These are Boolean, numeric or
       string names with corresponding values:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Boolean capabilities are true  when  present,  false  when  absent.
           There is no explicit value for Boolean capabilities.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Numeric  capabilities  have  a  "#"  following  the  name,  then an
           unsigned decimal integer value.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   String capabilities have a "=" following the name, then  an  string
           of characters making up the capability value.

           String  capabilities  can be split into multiple lines, just as the
           fields comprising a terminal  entry  can  be  split  into  multiple
           lines.   While  blanks  between fields are ignored, blanks embedded
           within a string value are retained, except for leading blanks on  a
           line.

       Any  capability  can  be  <EM>canceled</EM>,  i.e., suppressed from the terminal
       entry, by following its name with "@" rather than a capability value.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Similar-Terminals">Similar Terminals</a></H3><PRE>
       If there are two very similar  terminals,  one  (the  variant)  can  be
       defined   as  being  just  like  the  other  (the  base)  with  certain
       exceptions.  In the definition of the variant,  the  string  capability
       <STRONG>use</STRONG> can be given with the name of the base terminal:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  capabilities  given before <STRONG>use</STRONG> override those in the base type
           named by <STRONG>use</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If there are multiple <STRONG>use</STRONG> capabilities, they are merged in  reverse
           order.   That  is,  the rightmost <STRONG>use</STRONG> reference is processed first,
           then the one to its left, and so forth.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Capabilities given explicitly in the entry override  those  brought
           in by <STRONG>use</STRONG> references.

       A  capability  can  be  canceled  by placing <STRONG>xx@</STRONG> to the left of the use
       reference that imports it, where <EM>xx</EM> is the  capability.   For  example,
       the entry

              2621-nl, smkx@, rmkx@, use=2621,

       defines a 2621-nl that does not have the <STRONG>smkx</STRONG> or <STRONG>rmkx</STRONG> capabilities, and
       hence does not turn on the function key labels  when  in  visual  mode.
       This  is  useful  for  different modes for a terminal, or for different
       user preferences.

       An entry included via <STRONG>use</STRONG> can contain canceled capabilities, which have
       the  same  effect as if those cancels were inline in the using terminal
       entry.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Predefined-Capabilities">Predefined Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       Tables of capabilities <EM>ncurses</EM> recognizes in a <EM>terminfo</EM>  terminal  type
       description and available to <EM>terminfo</EM>-using code follow.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  capability  name identifies the symbol by which the programmer
           using the <EM>terminfo</EM> API accesses the capability.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The TI (<EM>terminfo</EM>) code is the short name used by a person composing
           or updating a terminal type entry.

           Whenever  possible, these codes are the same as or similar to those
           of the ANSI X3.64-1979 standard (now superseded by  ECMA-48,  which
           uses identical or very similar names).  Semantics are also intended
           to match those of the specification.

           <EM>terminfo</EM> codes have no hard length limit, but <EM>ncurses</EM> maintains  an
           informal  one  of  5 characters to keep them short and to allow the
           tabs in the source file <EM>Caps</EM> to line  up  nicely.   (Some  standard
           codes exceed this limit regardless.)

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  TC  (<EM>termcap</EM>)  code  is  that used by the corresponding API of
           <EM>ncurses</EM>.  (Some capabilities are  new,  and  have  names  that  BSD
           <EM>termcap</EM> did not originate.)

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The   description   field   attempts  to  convey  the  capability's
           semantics.

       The description field employs a handful of notations.

       <STRONG>(P)</STRONG>    indicates that padding may be specified.

       <STRONG>(P*)</STRONG>   indicates that padding may vary in proportion to the  number  of
              output lines affected.

       <STRONG>#</STRONG><EM>i</EM>     indicates   the  <EM>i</EM>th  parameter  of  a  string  capability;  the
              programmer  should  pass  the  string  to  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>  with   the
              parameters listed.

              If  the  description  lists no parameters, passing the string to
              <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG> may produce unexpected behavior, for instance  if  the
              string contains percent signs.

       The  XSI  Curses standard added these hardcopy capabilities.  They were
       used in some post-4.1 versions of System V curses,  e.g.,  Solaris  2.5
       and  IRIX  6.x.   Except for <STRONG>YI</STRONG>, the <STRONG>ncurses</STRONG> termcap names for them are
       invented.  According to the XSI Curses standard, they have  no  termcap
       names.   If  your  compiled terminfo entries use these, they may not be
       binary-compatible with System V terminfo entries after SVr4.1; beware!

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-User-Defined-Capabilities">User-Defined Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       The  preceding  section  listed the <EM>predefined</EM> capabilities.  They deal
       with some special features for terminals no longer (or possibly  never)
       produced.   Occasionally  there are special features of newer terminals
       which are awkward or impossible to represent by reusing the  predefined
       capabilities.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>    addresses   this   limitation   by   allowing   user-defined
       capabilities.  The <STRONG>tic</STRONG> and <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG> programs provide the <STRONG>-x</STRONG>  option  for
       this purpose.  When <STRONG>-x</STRONG> is set, <STRONG>tic</STRONG> treats unknown capabilities as user-
       defined.  That is, if <STRONG>tic</STRONG> encounters a capability name  which  it  does
       not  recognize, it infers its type (Boolean, number or string) from the
       syntax and makes an extended table  entry  for  that  capability.   The
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_extend.3x.html">use_extended_names(3x)</A></STRONG>  function  makes  this information conditionally
       available to applications.   The  <EM>ncurses</EM>  library  provides  the  data
       leaving most of the behavior to applications:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   User-defined  capability  strings  whose  name  begins with "k" are
           treated as function keys.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The types (Boolean,  number,  string)  determined  by  <STRONG>tic</STRONG>  can  be
           inferred by successful calls on <STRONG>tigetflag</STRONG>, etc.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the capability name happens to be two characters, the capability
           is also available through the termcap interface.

       While termcap is said to be  extensible  because  it  does  not  use  a
       predefined  set of capabilities, in practice it has been limited to the
       capabilities defined by terminfo implementations.   As  a  rule,  user-
       defined capabilities intended for use by termcap applications should be
       limited to Booleans and numbers to avoid running  past  the  1023  byte
       limit  assumed  by  termcap implementations and their applications.  In
       particular, providing extended sets  of  function  keys  (past  the  60
       numbered keys and the handful of special named keys) is best done using
       the longer names available using terminfo.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> library uses a few of these user-defined  capabilities,  as
       described  in <STRONG><A HREF="user_caps.5.html">user_caps(5)</A></STRONG>.  Other user-defined capabilities (including
       function keys) are described in the terminal database, in  the  section
       on <EM>NCURSES</EM> <EM>USER-DEFINABLE</EM> <EM>CAPABILITIES</EM>

       Entries  may continue onto multiple lines by placing white space at the
       beginning of each line except the first.  Comments may be  included  on
       lines beginning with "#".  Capabilities in <EM>terminfo</EM> are of three types:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Boolean  capabilities  which  indicate  that  the terminal has some
           particular feature,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   numeric capabilities giving the size of the terminal or the size of
           particular delays, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   string  capabilities,  which  give  a sequence which can be used to
           perform particular terminal operations.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Types-of-Capabilities">Types of Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       All capabilities have names.  For instance, the fact that ANSI-standard
       terminals  have  <EM>automatic</EM> <EM>margins</EM> (i.e., an automatic return and line-
       feed when the end of a line is reached) is indicated by the  capability
       <STRONG>am</STRONG>.   Hence  the description of ansi includes <STRONG>am</STRONG>.  Numeric capabilities
       are followed by the character "#" and  then  a  positive  value.   Thus
       <STRONG>cols</STRONG>, which indicates the number of columns the terminal has, gives the
       value "80" for ansi.  Values for numeric capabilities may be  specified
       in  decimal,  octal,  or  hexadecimal, using the C programming language
       conventions (e.g., 255, 0377 and 0xff or 0xFF).

       Finally, string valued capabilities, such as <STRONG>el</STRONG> (clear to end  of  line
       sequence)  are  given  by  the  two-character  code, an "=", and then a
       string ending at the next following ",".

       A number  of  escape  sequences  are  provided  in  the  string  valued
       capabilities for easy encoding of characters there:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Both <STRONG>\E</STRONG> and <STRONG>\e</STRONG> map to an ESCAPE character,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>^</STRONG><STRONG><EM>x</EM></STRONG> maps to a control-<EM>x</EM> for any appropriate <EM>x</EM>, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the sequences

             <STRONG>\n</STRONG>, <STRONG>\l</STRONG>, <STRONG>\r</STRONG>, <STRONG>\t</STRONG>, <STRONG>\b</STRONG>, <STRONG>\f</STRONG>, and <STRONG>\s</STRONG>

           produce

             <EM>newline</EM>, <EM>line-feed</EM>, <EM>return</EM>, <EM>tab</EM>, <EM>backspace</EM>, <EM>form-feed</EM>, and <EM>space</EM>,

           respectively.

       X/Open Curses does not say what "appropriate <EM>x</EM>" might be.  In practice,
       that is a printable ASCII graphic character.  The special case "^?"  is
       interpreted  as  DEL (127).  In all other cases, the character value is
       logically "and"-ed with 0x1f, mapping to ASCII  control  codes  in  the
       range 0 through 31.

       Other escapes include

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\^</STRONG> for <STRONG>^</STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\\</STRONG> for <STRONG>\</STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\</STRONG>, for comma,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>\:</STRONG> for <STRONG>:</STRONG>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and <STRONG>\0</STRONG> for null.

           <STRONG>\0</STRONG> will produce \200, which does not terminate a string but behaves
           as a null character on most terminals, providing CS7 is  specified.
           See <STRONG>stty(1)</STRONG>.

           The  reason  for  this quirk is to maintain binary compatibility of
           the compiled terminfo files with other implementations,  e.g.,  the
           SVr4  systems,  which  document  this.  Compiled terminfo files use
           null-terminated strings, with no  lengths.   Modifying  this  would
           require  a  new  binary  format,  which  would  not work with other
           implementations.

       Finally, characters may be given as three octal digits after a <STRONG>\</STRONG>.

       A delay in milliseconds may appear anywhere  in  a  string  capability,
       enclosed  in  $&lt;..&gt;  brackets, as in <STRONG>el</STRONG>=\EK$&lt;5&gt;, and padding characters
       are supplied by <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tputs(3x)</A></STRONG> to provide this delay.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The delay must be a number  with  at  most  one  decimal  place  of
           precision; it may be followed by suffixes "*" or "/" or both.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A  "*"  indicates  that the padding required is proportional to the
           number of lines affected by the operation, and the amount given  is
           the  per-affected-unit  padding  required.   (In the case of insert
           character, the factor is still the number of <EM>lines</EM> affected.)

           Normally, padding is advisory if the device has the <STRONG>xon</STRONG> capability;
           it is used for cost computation but does not trigger delays.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A  "/"  suffix indicates that the padding is mandatory and forces a
           delay of the given number of milliseconds even on devices for which
           <STRONG>xon</STRONG> is present to indicate flow control.

       Sometimes  individual  capabilities must be commented out.  To do this,
       put a period before the capability name.  For example, see  the  second
       <STRONG>ind</STRONG> in the example above.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Fetching-Compiled-Descriptions">Fetching Compiled Descriptions</a></H3><PRE>
       Terminal  descriptions  in  <EM>ncurses</EM>  are  stored in terminal databases.
       These databases, which are found by their pathname, may  be  configured
       either as directory trees or hashed databases (see <STRONG><A HREF="term.5.html">term(5)</A></STRONG>),

       The  library  uses  a  compiled-in  list  of  pathnames,  which  can be
       overridden  by  environment  variables.   Before  starting  to  search,
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  checks  the  search list, eliminating duplicates and pathnames
       where no terminal database is found.  The  <EM>ncurses</EM>  library  reads  the
       first description which passes its consistency checks.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  environment variable <STRONG>TERMINFO</STRONG> is checked first, for a terminal
           database containing the terminal description.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Next, <EM>ncurses</EM> looks in <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM> for a compiled description.

           This is an optional feature which may be omitted entirely from  the
           library,  or  limited  to  prevent  accidental  use  by  privileged
           applications.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Next, if the environment variable  <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM>  is  set,  <EM>ncurses</EM>
           interprets  the  contents  of  that  variable  as  a list of colon-
           separated pathnames of terminal databases to be searched.

           An empty pathname (i.e., if the variable  begins  or  ends  with  a
           colon,  or  contains  adjacent colons) is interpreted as the system
           location <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Finally, <EM>ncurses</EM> searches these compiled-in locations:

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a list of directories (/usr/share/terminfo), and

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the system terminfo directory, <EM>/usr/share/terminfo</EM>

       The <STRONG>TERMINFO</STRONG> variable can contain a terminal description instead of the
       pathname  of  a terminal database.  If this variable begins with "hex:"
       or "b64:" then <EM>ncurses</EM> reads a terminal description  from  hexadecimal-
       or  base64-encoded  data,  and  if  that  description  matches the name
       sought, will use that.  This encoded data can be  set  using  the  "-Q"
       option of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> or <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG>.

       The  preceding addresses the usual configuration of <EM>ncurses</EM>, which uses
       terminal descriptions prepared in <EM>terminfo</EM> format.   While  <EM>termcap</EM>  is
       less  expressive,  <EM>ncurses</EM>  can  also  be  configured  to  read <EM>termcap</EM>
       descriptions.   In  that  configuration,  it  checks  the  <EM>TERMCAP</EM>  and
       <EM>TERMPATH</EM>  variables  (for  content and search path, respectively) after
       the system terminal database.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Preparing-Descriptions">Preparing Descriptions</a></H3><PRE>
       We now outline how to prepare  descriptions  of  terminals.   The  most
       effective  way  to  prepare  a terminal description is by imitating the
       description of a similar  terminal  in  <EM>terminfo</EM>  and  to  build  up  a
       description gradually, using partial descriptions with <EM>vi</EM> or some other
       screen-oriented program to check that they are correct.  Be aware  that
       a  very  unusual terminal may expose deficiencies in the ability of the
       <EM>terminfo</EM> file to describe it or bugs in the screen-handling code of the
       test program.

       To  get the padding for insert line right (if the terminal manufacturer
       did not document it) a severe test is to edit  a  large  file  at  9600
       baud, delete 16 or so lines from the middle of the screen, then hit the
       "u" key several times quickly.  If the terminal messes up, more padding
       is usually needed.  A similar test can be used for insert character.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Basic-Capabilities">Basic Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       The  number  of  columns  on each line for the terminal is given by the
       <STRONG>cols</STRONG> numeric capability.  If the terminal is a CRT, then the number  of
       lines  on the screen is given by the <STRONG>lines</STRONG> capability.  If the terminal
       wraps around to the beginning of the next  line  when  it  reaches  the
       right  margin,  then it should have the <STRONG>am</STRONG> capability.  If the terminal
       can clear its screen, leaving the cursor in  the  home  position,  then
       this  is  given  by  the  <STRONG>clear</STRONG>  string  capability.   If  the terminal
       overstrikes (rather than clearing a position when a character is struck
       over)  then  it  should  have  the <STRONG>os</STRONG> capability.  If the terminal is a
       printing terminal, with no soft copy unit, give it both <STRONG>hc</STRONG> and <STRONG>os</STRONG>.  (<STRONG>os</STRONG>
       applies  to  storage scope terminals, such as TEKTRONIX 4010 series, as
       well as hard copy and APL terminals.)  If there is a code to  move  the
       cursor  to  the  left  edge  of  the  current  line,  give  this as <STRONG>cr</STRONG>.
       (Normally this will be carriage return, control/M.)  If there is a code
       to produce an audible signal (bell, beep, etc) give this as <STRONG>bel</STRONG>.

       If there is a code to move the cursor one position to the left (such as
       backspace) that capability should be given as <STRONG>cub1</STRONG>.   Similarly,  codes
       to  move  to the right, up, and down should be given as <STRONG>cuf1</STRONG>, <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>, and
       <STRONG>cud1</STRONG>.  These local cursor motions should not alter the text  they  pass
       over,  for  example,  you  would  not normally use "<STRONG>cuf1</STRONG>= " because the
       space would erase the character moved over.

       A very important point here is that the local cursor motions encoded in
       <EM>terminfo</EM>  are  undefined  at  the left and top edges of a CRT terminal.
       Programs should never attempt to backspace around the left edge, unless
       <STRONG>bw</STRONG>  is given, and never attempt to go up locally off the top.  In order
       to scroll text up, a program will go to the bottom left corner  of  the
       screen and send the <STRONG>ind</STRONG> (index) string.

       To  scroll  text  down,  a  program  goes to the top left corner of the
       screen and sends the <STRONG>ri</STRONG> (reverse index) string.  The strings <STRONG>ind</STRONG> and <STRONG>ri</STRONG>
       are undefined when not on their respective corners of the screen.

       Parameterized  versions  of  the  scrolling  sequences are <STRONG>indn</STRONG> and <STRONG>rin</STRONG>
       which have the same semantics as <STRONG>ind</STRONG> and <STRONG>ri</STRONG> except that they  take  one
       parameter,  and scroll that many lines.  They are also undefined except
       at the appropriate edge of the screen.

       The <STRONG>am</STRONG> capability tells whether the cursor sticks at the right edge  of
       the  screen when text is output, but this does not necessarily apply to
       a <STRONG>cuf1</STRONG> from the last column.  The only local motion  which  is  defined
       from  the  left  edge is if <STRONG>bw</STRONG> is given, then a <STRONG>cub1</STRONG> from the left edge
       will move to the right edge of the previous line.  If <STRONG>bw</STRONG> is not  given,
       the  effect  is undefined.  This is useful for drawing a box around the
       edge of the screen, for example.  If the terminal has switch selectable
       automatic  margins,  the <EM>terminfo</EM> file usually assumes that this is on;
       i.e., <STRONG>am</STRONG>.  If the terminal has a  command  which  moves  to  the  first
       column  of  the  next line, that command can be given as <STRONG>nel</STRONG> (newline).
       It does not matter if the command clears the remainder of  the  current
       line,  so  if the terminal has no <STRONG>cr</STRONG> and <STRONG>lf</STRONG> it may still be possible to
       craft a working <STRONG>nel</STRONG> out of one or both of them.

       These  capabilities  suffice  to  describe  hard-copy  and  "glass-tty"
       terminals.  Thus the model 33 teletype is described as

       33|tty33|tty|model 33 teletype,
               bel=^G, cols#72, cr=^M, cud1=^J, hc, ind=^J, os,

       while the Lear Siegler ADM-3 is described as

       adm3|3|lsi adm3,
               am, bel=^G, clear=^Z, cols#80, cr=^M, cub1=^H, cud1=^J,
               ind=^J, lines#24,


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Parameterized-Strings">Parameterized Strings</a></H3><PRE>
       Cursor  addressing  and  other  strings  requiring  parameters  in  the
       terminal are described  by  a  parameterized  string  capability,  with
       <EM>printf</EM>-like  escapes  such  as  <EM>%x</EM>  in it.  For example, to address the
       cursor, the <STRONG>cup</STRONG> capability is given, using two parameters: the line and
       column  to  address  to.  (Lines and columns are numbered from zero and
       refer to the physical screen visible to the user,  not  to  any  unseen
       memory.)   If  the terminal has memory relative cursor addressing, that
       can be indicated by <STRONG>mrcup</STRONG>.

       The parameter mechanism uses a stack and special <STRONG>%</STRONG> codes to  manipulate
       it.   Typically  a  sequence  will  push one of the parameters onto the
       stack and then print it in  some  format.   Print  (e.g.,  "%d")  is  a
       special  case.  Other operations, including "%t" pop their operand from
       the stack.   It  is  noted  that  more  complex  operations  are  often
       necessary, e.g., in the <STRONG>sgr</STRONG> string.

       The <STRONG>%</STRONG> encodings have the following meanings:

       <STRONG>%%</STRONG>   outputs "%"

       <STRONG>%</STRONG><EM>[[</EM>:<EM>]flags][width[.precision]][</EM><STRONG>doxXs</STRONG><EM>]</EM>
            as  in  <STRONG>printf(3)</STRONG>,  flags are <EM>[-+#]</EM> and <EM>space</EM>.  Use a ":" to allow
            the next character to be a "-" flag, avoiding interpreting "%-" as
            an operator.

       <STRONG>%c</STRONG>   print <EM>pop()</EM> like %c in <STRONG>printf</STRONG>

       <STRONG>%s</STRONG>   print <EM>pop()</EM> like %s in <STRONG>printf</STRONG>

       <STRONG>%p</STRONG><EM>[1-9]</EM>
            push <EM>i</EM>'th parameter

       <STRONG>%P</STRONG><EM>[a-z]</EM>
            set dynamic variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> to <EM>pop()</EM>

       <STRONG>%g</STRONG><EM>[a-z]</EM>
            get dynamic variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> and push it

       <STRONG>%P</STRONG><EM>[A-Z]</EM>
            set static variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> to <EM>pop()</EM>

       <STRONG>%g</STRONG><EM>[A-Z]</EM>
            get static variable <EM>[a-z]</EM> and push it

            The  terms  "static"  and "dynamic" are misleading.  Historically,
            these are simply two different sets of variables, whose values are
            not  reset  between calls to <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>.  However, that fact is not
            documented in other implementations.  Relying on it will adversely
            impact portability to other implementations:

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr2  curses  supported <EM>dynamic</EM> variables.  Those are set only
                by a <STRONG>%P</STRONG> operator.  A <STRONG>%g</STRONG> for a  given  variable  without  first
                setting  it  with  <STRONG>%P</STRONG> will give unpredictable results, because
                dynamic variables are an  uninitialized  local  array  on  the
                stack in the <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> function.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr3.2  curses supported <EM>static</EM> variables.  Those are an array
                in the <EM>TERMINAL</EM> structure (declared in <STRONG>term.h</STRONG>), and are zeroed
                automatically when the <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> function allocates the data.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4 curses made no further improvements to the <EM>dynamic/static</EM>
                variable feature.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Solaris XPG4 curses does not distinguish between  <EM>dynamic</EM>  and
                <EM>static</EM>  variables.  They are the same.  Like SVr4 curses, XPG4
                curses does not initialize these explicitly.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Before version 6.3, <EM>ncurses</EM> stores  both  <EM>dynamic</EM>  and  <EM>static</EM>
                variables in persistent storage, initialized to zeros.

            <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Beginning  with version 6.3, <EM>ncurses</EM> stores <EM>static</EM> and <EM>dynamic</EM>
                variables in the same manner as SVr4.

                <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Unlike  other  implementations,  <EM>ncurses</EM>   zeros   dynamic
                    variables before the first <STRONG>%g</STRONG> or <STRONG>%P</STRONG> operator.

                <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Like  SVr2,  the  scope of dynamic variables in <EM>ncurses</EM> is
                    within the current call to <STRONG>tparm</STRONG>.  Use static variables if
                    persistent storage is needed.

       <STRONG>%?</STRONG> <EM>expr</EM> <STRONG>%t</STRONG> <EM>thenpart</EM> <STRONG>%e</STRONG> <EM>elsepart</EM> <STRONG>%;</STRONG>
            This forms an if-then-else.  The <STRONG>%e</STRONG> <EM>elsepart</EM> is optional.  Usually
            the  <STRONG>%?</STRONG>  <EM>expr</EM>  part  pushes a value onto the stack, and <STRONG>%t</STRONG> pops it
            from the stack, testing if it is nonzero (true).  If  it  is  zero
            (false), control passes to the <STRONG>%e</STRONG> (else) part.

            It is possible to form else-if's a la Algol 68:
            <STRONG>%?</STRONG> c1 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b1 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> c2 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b2 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> c3 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b3 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> c4 <STRONG>%t</STRONG> b4 <STRONG>%e</STRONG> <STRONG>%;</STRONG>

            where ci are conditions, bi are bodies.

            Use  the  <STRONG>-f</STRONG>  option of <STRONG>tic</STRONG> or <STRONG>infocmp</STRONG> to see the structure of if-
            then-else's.  Some strings, e.g., <STRONG>sgr</STRONG> can be very complicated when
            written  on  one line.  The <STRONG>-f</STRONG> option splits the string into lines
            with the parts indented.

       Binary operations are in postfix form with the operands  in  the  usual
       order.   That  is,  to  get  x-5  one would use "%gx%{5}%-".  <STRONG>%P</STRONG> and <STRONG>%g</STRONG>
       variables are persistent across escape-string evaluations.

       Consider the HP2645, which, to get to line 3 and column 12, needs to be
       sent  \E&amp;a12c03Y padded for 6 milliseconds.  The order of the lines and
       columns is inverted here, and the lines and column are printed  as  two
       digits.  The corresponding terminal description is expressed thus:
              cup=\E&amp;a%p2%dc%p1%dY$&lt;6&gt;,

       The Microterm ACT-IV needs the current line and column sent preceded by
       a <STRONG>^T</STRONG>, with the line and column simply encoded in binary,
              cup=^T%p1%c%p2%c

       Terminals which use "%c" need  to  be  able  to  backspace  the  cursor
       (<STRONG>cub1</STRONG>),  and to move the cursor up one line on the screen (<STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>).  This
       is necessary because it is not always safe to transmit <STRONG>\n</STRONG> <STRONG>^D</STRONG> and <STRONG>\r</STRONG>, as
       the  system  may change or discard them.  (The library routines dealing
       with terminfo set tty modes so that tabs are never expanded, so  \t  is
       safe to send.  This turns out to be essential for the Ann Arbor 4080.)

       A final example is the LSI ADM-3A, which uses line and column offset by
       a space, thus
              cup=\E=%p1%' '%+%c%p2%' '%+%c

       After sending "\E=", this pushes the first parameter, pushes the  ASCII
       value  for  a  space  (32),  adds them (pushing the sum on the stack in
       place of  the  two  previous  values)  and  outputs  that  value  as  a
       character.   Then  the  same  is  done  for the second parameter.  More
       complex arithmetic is possible using the stack.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Cursor-Motions">Cursor Motions</a></H3><PRE>
       If the terminal has a fast way to home the cursor (to very  upper  left
       corner  of screen) then this can be given as <STRONG>home</STRONG>; similarly a fast way
       of getting to the lower left-hand corner can be given as <STRONG>ll</STRONG>;  this  may
       involve going up with <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG> from the home position, but a program should
       never do this itself (unless <STRONG>ll</STRONG> does) because it can make no assumption
       about  the  effect  of moving up from the home position.  Note that the
       home position is the same as addressing  to  (0,0):  to  the  top  left
       corner  of  the  screen,  not of memory.  (Thus, the \EH sequence on HP
       terminals cannot be used for <STRONG>home</STRONG>.)

       If the terminal has line or column absolute  cursor  addressing,  these
       can  be given as single parameter capabilities <STRONG>hpa</STRONG> (horizontal position
       absolute) and <STRONG>vpa</STRONG> (vertical position absolute).   Sometimes  these  are
       shorter  than  the  more  general  two  parameter sequence (as with the
       hp2645)  and  can  be  used  in  preference  to  <STRONG>cup</STRONG>.   If  there   are
       parameterized  local  motions  (e.g., move <EM>n</EM> spaces to the right) these
       can be given as  <STRONG>cud</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cub</STRONG>,  <STRONG>cuf</STRONG>,  and  <STRONG>cuu</STRONG>  with  a  single  parameter
       indicating  how many spaces to move.  These are primarily useful if the
       terminal does not have <STRONG>cup</STRONG>, such as the TEKTRONIX 4025.

       If the terminal needs to be in a special mode when  running  a  program
       that uses these capabilities, the codes to enter and exit this mode can
       be given as <STRONG>smcup</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>.  This arises, for example, from  terminals
       like  the  Concept  with more than one page of memory.  If the terminal
       has only memory relative cursor  addressing  and  not  screen  relative
       cursor  addressing,  a  one  screen-sized window must be fixed into the
       terminal for cursor addressing to work properly.  This is also used for
       the  TEKTRONIX  4025,  where <STRONG>smcup</STRONG> sets the command character to be the
       one used by terminfo.  If the  <STRONG>smcup</STRONG>  sequence  will  not  restore  the
       screen  after  an  <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>  sequence  is  output  (to  the state prior to
       outputting <STRONG>rmcup</STRONG>), specify <STRONG>nrrmc</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Margins">Margins</a></H3><PRE>
       SVr4 (and X/Open Curses) list several string capabilities  for  setting
       margins.   Two  were  intended  for use with terminals, and another six
       were intended for use with printers.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The two terminal capabilities assume that the terminal may have the
           capability  of  setting the left and/or right margin at the current
           cursor column position.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The printer capabilities assume that the printer may have two types
           of capability:

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   the ability to set a top and/or bottom margin using the current
               line position, and

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   parameterized capabilities for setting the top,  bottom,  left,
               right margins given the number of lines or columns.

       In  practice,  the  categorization into "terminal" and "printer" is not
       suitable:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The AT&amp;T SVr4 terminal database uses  <STRONG>smgl</STRONG>  four  times,  for  AT&amp;T
           hardware.

           Three  of  the  four  are  printers.   They lack the ability to set
           left/right margins by specifying the column.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Other (non-AT&amp;T) terminals may support margins but using  different
           assumptions from AT&amp;T.

           For  instance,  the DEC VT420 supports left/right margins, but only
           using a column parameter.  As an added complication, the VT420 uses
           two  settings to fully enable left/right margins (left/right margin
           mode, and origin mode).  The  former  enables  the  margins,  which
           causes  printed  text  to  wrap  within  margins, but the latter is
           needed to prevent cursor-addressing outside those margins.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Both DEC VT420 left/right margins are set  with  a  single  control
           sequence.  If either is omitted, the corresponding margin is set to
           the left or right edge of the  display  (rather  than  leaving  the
           margin unmodified).

       These are the margin-related capabilities:

                 <STRONG>Name</STRONG>    <STRONG>Description</STRONG>
                 ---------------------------------------------------
                 <STRONG>smgl</STRONG>    Set left margin at current column
                 <STRONG>smgr</STRONG>    Set right margin at current column
                 <STRONG>smgb</STRONG>    Set bottom margin at current line
                 <STRONG>smgt</STRONG>    Set top margin at current line
                 <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG>   Set bottom margin at line <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smglp</STRONG>   Set left margin at column <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG>   Set right margin at column <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG>   Set top margin at line <EM>N</EM>
                 <STRONG>smglr</STRONG>   Set both left and right margins to <EM>L</EM> and <EM>R</EM>
                 <STRONG>smgtb</STRONG>   Set both top and bottom margins to <EM>T</EM> and <EM>B</EM>

       When  writing  an  application that uses these string capabilities, the
       pairs should be first checked to see if each capability in the pair  is
       set or only one is set:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  both  <STRONG>smglp</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG>  are  set,  each  is used with a single
           argument, <EM>N</EM>, that gives the column number of  the  left  and  right
           margin, respectively.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  both  <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG>  and <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> are set, each is used to set the top and
           bottom margin, respectively:

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG> is used with a single argument, <EM>N</EM>, the line number of the
               top margin.

           <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG>  is  used with two arguments, <EM>N</EM> and <EM>M</EM>, that give the line
               number of the bottom margin, the first counting from the top of
               the  page  and  the  second  counting  from  the  bottom.  This
               accommodates the two styles of specifying the bottom margin  in
               different manufacturers' printers.

           When  designing  a terminfo entry for a printer that has a settable
           bottom margin, only the first or second argument  should  be  used,
           depending on the printer.  When developing an application that uses
           <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> to set the bottom margin, both arguments must be given.

       Conversely, when only one capability in the pair is set:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If only one of <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG> is set, then it  is  used  with  two
           arguments, the column number of the left and right margins, in that
           order.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Likewise, if only one of <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG> is set, then  it  is  used
           with  two  arguments  that give the top and bottom margins, in that
           order, counting from the top of the page.

           When designing a terminfo entry for a printer that requires setting
           both  left and right or top and bottom margins simultaneously, only
           one capability in the pairs <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and  <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>smgtp</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>smgbp</STRONG>
           should be defined, leaving the other unset.

       Except  for  very  old terminal descriptions, e.g., those developed for
       SVr4, the scheme just described  should  be  considered  obsolete.   An
       improved set of capabilities was added late in the SVr4 releases (<STRONG>smglr</STRONG>
       and <STRONG>smgtb</STRONG>),  which  explicitly  use  two  parameters  for  setting  the
       left/right or top/bottom margins.

       When setting margins, the line- and column-values are zero-based.

       The  <STRONG>mgc</STRONG>  string  capability  should  be defined.  Applications such as
       <STRONG><A HREF="tabs.1.html">tabs(1)</A></STRONG> rely upon this to reset all margins.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Area-Clears">Area Clears</a></H3><PRE>
       If the terminal can clear from the current position to the end  of  the
       line,  leaving  the cursor where it is, this should be given as <STRONG>el</STRONG>.  If
       the terminal can clear from the beginning of the line  to  the  current
       position  inclusive,  leaving  the  cursor  where it is, this should be
       given as <STRONG>el1</STRONG>.  If the terminal can clear from the current  position  to
       the  end  of  the display, then this should be given as <STRONG>ed</STRONG>.  <STRONG>Ed</STRONG> is only
       defined from the first column of a line.  (Thus, it can be simulated by
       a  request  to  delete  a  large  number  of lines, if a true <STRONG>ed</STRONG> is not
       available.)


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Insert_Delete-Line-and-Vertical-Motions">Insert/Delete Line and Vertical Motions</a></H3><PRE>
       If the terminal can open a new blank line before  the  line  where  the
       cursor  is,  this  should  be  given as <STRONG>il1</STRONG>; this is done only from the
       first position of a line.  The cursor must then  appear  on  the  newly
       blank  line.   If  the terminal can delete the line which the cursor is
       on, then this should be given as <STRONG>dl1</STRONG>; this is done only from the  first
       position on the line to be deleted.  Versions of <STRONG>il1</STRONG> and <STRONG>dl1</STRONG> which take
       a single parameter and insert or delete that many lines can be given as
       <STRONG>il</STRONG> and <STRONG>dl</STRONG>.

       If  the  terminal  has a settable scrolling region (like the vt100) the
       command to set this can be described with  the  <STRONG>csr</STRONG>  capability,  which
       takes two parameters: the top and bottom lines of the scrolling region.
       The cursor position is, alas, undefined after using this command.

       It is possible to get the effect of insert or delete line using <STRONG>csr</STRONG>  on
       a  properly  chosen  region;  the  <STRONG>sc</STRONG>  and <STRONG>rc</STRONG> (save and restore cursor)
       commands may be useful for ensuring that your synthesized insert/delete
       string  does  not  move the cursor.  (Note that the <STRONG><A HREF="ncurses.3x.html">ncurses(3x)</A></STRONG> library
       does  this  synthesis  automatically,   so   you   need   not   compose
       insert/delete strings for an entry with <STRONG>csr</STRONG>).

       Yet  another  way  to  construct  insert  and  delete might be to use a
       combination of  index  with  the  memory-lock  feature  found  on  some
       terminals   (like   the   HP-700/90  series,  which  however  also  has
       insert/delete).

       Inserting lines at the top or bottom of the screen  can  also  be  done
       using  <STRONG>ri</STRONG>  or  <STRONG>ind</STRONG> on many terminals without a true insert/delete line,
       and is often faster even on terminals with those features.

       The Boolean <STRONG>non_dest_scroll_region</STRONG> should  be  set  if  each  scrolling
       window  is  effectively  a view port on a screen-sized canvas.  To test
       for this capability, create a scrolling region in  the  middle  of  the
       screen,  write something to the bottom line, move the cursor to the top
       of the region, and do <STRONG>ri</STRONG> followed by <STRONG>dl1</STRONG> or <STRONG>ind</STRONG>.  If the data  scrolled
       off  the  bottom  of the region by the <STRONG>ri</STRONG> re-appears, then scrolling is
       non-destructive.  System V and X/Open Curses expect that <STRONG>ind</STRONG>, <STRONG>ri</STRONG>, <STRONG>indn</STRONG>,
       and  <STRONG>rin</STRONG>  will  simulate  destructive  scrolling;  their  documentation
       cautions you not to define  <STRONG>csr</STRONG>  unless  this  is  true.   This  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>
       implementation  is  more  liberal  and  will  do  explicit erases after
       scrolling if <STRONG>ndsrc</STRONG> is defined.

       If the terminal has the ability to define a window as part  of  memory,
       which  all  commands  affect,  it  should be given as the parameterized
       string <STRONG>wind</STRONG>.  The four parameters are the starting and ending lines  in
       memory and the starting and ending columns in memory, in that order.

       If the terminal can retain display memory above, then the <STRONG>da</STRONG> capability
       should be given; if display memory  can  be  retained  below,  then  <STRONG>db</STRONG>
       should  be given.  These indicate that deleting a line or scrolling may
       bring non-blank lines up from below or that scrolling back with <STRONG>ri</STRONG>  may
       bring down non-blank lines.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Insert_Delete-Character">Insert/Delete Character</a></H3><PRE>
       There  are  two  basic  kinds  of intelligent terminals with respect to
       insert/delete character which can be  described  using  <EM>terminfo</EM>.   The
       most   common   insert/delete  character  operations  affect  only  the
       characters on the current line and shift characters off the end of  the
       line  rigidly.  Other terminals, such as the Concept 100 and the Perkin
       Elmer Owl, make a distinction between typed and untyped blanks  on  the
       screen,  shifting  upon an insert or delete only to an untyped blank on
       the screen which is either  eliminated,  or  expanded  to  two  untyped
       blanks.

       You  can determine the kind of terminal you have by clearing the screen
       and then typing text separated by cursor  motions.   Type  "abc    def"
       using  local  cursor  motions  (not  spaces)  between the "abc" and the
       "def".  Then position the cursor before the "abc" and put the  terminal
       in  insert  mode.   If typing characters causes the rest of the line to
       shift rigidly and characters to fall off the end,  then  your  terminal
       does  not  distinguish  between  blanks  and untyped positions.  If the
       "abc" shifts over to the "def" which then move together around the  end
       of  the  current  line  and  onto  the next as you insert, you have the
       second type of terminal, and  should  give  the  capability  <STRONG>in</STRONG>,  which
       stands for "insert null".

       While  these  are  two  logically  separate attributes (one line versus
       multi-line insert mode, and special treatment  of  untyped  spaces)  we
       have  seen  no terminals whose insert mode cannot be described with the
       single attribute.

       Terminfo can describe both terminals which have  an  insert  mode,  and
       terminals  which send a simple sequence to open a blank position on the
       current line.  Give as <STRONG>smir</STRONG> the sequence to get into insert mode.  Give
       as  <STRONG>rmir</STRONG>  the  sequence  to  leave  insert  mode.  Now give as <STRONG>ich1</STRONG> any
       sequence needed to be sent just before  sending  the  character  to  be
       inserted.   Most  terminals with a true insert mode will not give <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>;
       terminals which send a sequence to open a screen position  should  give
       it here.

       If  your  terminal has both, insert mode is usually preferable to <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>.
       Technically, you should not give  both  unless  the  terminal  actually
       requires  both to be used in combination.  Accordingly, some non-curses
       applications get confused if both are present; the symptom  is  doubled
       characters  in  an  update using insert.  This requirement is now rare;
       most <STRONG>ich</STRONG> sequences do not require previous smir, and most  smir  insert
       modes  do  not  require <STRONG>ich1</STRONG> before each character.  Therefore, the new
       <STRONG>curses</STRONG> actually assumes this is the case and uses either  <STRONG>rmir</STRONG>/<STRONG>smir</STRONG>  or
       <STRONG>ich</STRONG>/<STRONG>ich1</STRONG>  as appropriate (but not both).  If you have to write an entry
       to be used under new curses for a terminal old  enough  to  need  both,
       include the <STRONG>rmir</STRONG>/<STRONG>smir</STRONG> sequences in <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>.

       If post insert padding is needed, give this as a number of milliseconds
       in <STRONG>ip</STRONG> (a string option).  Any other sequence which may need to be  sent
       after an insert of a single character may also be given in <STRONG>ip</STRONG>.  If your
       terminal needs both to be placed into an "insert mode"  and  a  special
       code  to  precede each inserted character, then both <STRONG>smir</STRONG>/<STRONG>rmir</STRONG> and <STRONG>ich1</STRONG>
       can be given, and both will be used.   The  <STRONG>ich</STRONG>  capability,  with  one
       parameter, <EM>n</EM>, will repeat the effects of <STRONG>ich1</STRONG> <EM>n</EM> times.

       If  padding  is  necessary between characters typed while not in insert
       mode, give this as a number of milliseconds padding in <STRONG>rmp</STRONG>.

       It is occasionally necessary to move around while  in  insert  mode  to
       delete  characters  on the same line (e.g., if there is a tab after the
       insertion position).  If your terminal allows motion  while  in  insert
       mode  you  can  give  the  capability <STRONG>mir</STRONG> to speed up inserting in this
       case.  Omitting <STRONG>mir</STRONG> will affect only speed.   Some  terminals  (notably
       Datamedia's)  must  not  have  <STRONG>mir</STRONG> because of the way their insert mode
       works.

       Finally, you can specify <STRONG>dch1</STRONG> to delete a single  character,  <STRONG>dch</STRONG>  with
       one  parameter,  <EM>n</EM>,  to  delete <EM>n</EM> characters, and delete mode by giving
       <STRONG>smdc</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmdc</STRONG> to enter and exit delete  mode  (any  mode  the  terminal
       needs to be placed in for <STRONG>dch1</STRONG> to work).

       A  command  to  erase  <EM>n</EM>  characters (equivalent to outputting <EM>n</EM> blanks
       without moving the cursor) can be given as <STRONG>ech</STRONG> with one parameter.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Highlighting_Underlining_and-Visible-Bells">Highlighting, Underlining, and Visible Bells</a></H3><PRE>
       If your terminal has one or more kinds of display attributes, these can
       be  represented  in  a number of different ways.  You should choose one
       display form as <EM>standout</EM> <EM>mode</EM>,  representing  a  good,  high  contrast,
       easy-on-the-eyes,  format  for  highlighting  error  messages and other
       attention getters.  (If you have a choice,  reverse  video  plus  half-
       bright  is  good,  or reverse video alone.)  The sequences to enter and
       exit standout mode are given as <STRONG>smso</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmso</STRONG>,  respectively.   If  the
       code  to  change  into  or  out of standout mode leaves one or even two
       blank spaces on the screen, as the TVI 912 and Teleray  1061  do,  then
       <STRONG>xmc</STRONG> should be given to tell how many spaces are left.

       Codes to begin underlining and end underlining can be given as <STRONG>smul</STRONG> and
       <STRONG>rmul</STRONG> respectively.  If the terminal has a code to underline the current
       character  and  move  the  cursor  one  space to the right, such as the
       Microterm Mime, this can be given as <STRONG>uc</STRONG>.

       Other capabilities to enter various highlighting  modes  include  <STRONG>blink</STRONG>
       (blinking)  <STRONG>bold</STRONG>  (bold or extra bright) <STRONG>dim</STRONG> (dim or half-bright) <STRONG>invis</STRONG>
       (blanking or invisible text) <STRONG>prot</STRONG> (protected) <STRONG>rev</STRONG> (reverse video)  <STRONG>sgr0</STRONG>
       (turn  off  <EM>all</EM>  attribute  modes) <STRONG>smacs</STRONG> (enter alternate character set
       mode) and <STRONG>rmacs</STRONG> (exit alternate character set mode).  Turning on any of
       these modes singly may or may not turn off other modes.

       If  there  is  a  sequence to set arbitrary combinations of modes, this
       should be given as <STRONG>sgr</STRONG> (set attributes),  taking  9  parameters.   Each
       parameter is either zero (0) or nonzero, as the corresponding attribute
       is on or off.  The 9 parameters are,  in  order:  standout,  underline,
       reverse,  blink,  dim,  bold,  blank, protect, alternate character set.
       Not  all  modes  need  be  supported  by  <STRONG>sgr</STRONG>,  only  those  for  which
       corresponding separate attribute commands exist.

       For example, the DEC vt220 supports most of the modes:

                   <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> <STRONG>Parameter</STRONG>   <STRONG>Attribute</STRONG>    <STRONG>Escape</STRONG> <STRONG>Sequence</STRONG>
                   ------------------------------------------------
                   none              none         \E[0m
                   p1                standout     \E[0;1;7m
                   p2                underline    \E[0;4m
                   p3                reverse      \E[0;7m
                   p4                blink        \E[0;5m
                   p5                dim          not available
                   p6                bold         \E[0;1m
                   p7                invis        \E[0;8m
                   p8                protect      not used
                   p9                altcharset   ^O (off) ^N (on)

       We  begin each escape sequence by turning off any existing modes, since
       there is no quick way to determine whether they are  active.   Standout
       is  set  up  to  be  the  combination  of  reverse and bold.  The vt220
       terminal has a protect mode, though it is  not  commonly  used  in  sgr
       because  it protects characters on the screen from the host's erasures.
       The altcharset mode also is different in that it is either  ^O  or  ^N,
       depending  on whether it is off or on.  If all modes are turned on, the
       resulting sequence is \E[0;1;4;5;7;8m^N.

       Some sequences are common to  different  modes.   For  example,  ;7  is
       output  when  either  p1  or p3 is true, that is, if either standout or
       reverse modes are turned on.

       Writing out the above sequences, along with their dependencies yields

                 <STRONG>Sequence</STRONG>   <STRONG>When</STRONG> <STRONG>to</STRONG> <STRONG>Output</STRONG>      <STRONG>terminfo</STRONG> <STRONG>Translation</STRONG>
                 ----------------------------------------------------
                 \E[0       always              \E[0
                 ;1         if p1 or p6         %?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;
                 ;4         if p2               %?%p2%|%t;4%;
                 ;5         if p4               %?%p4%|%t;5%;
                 ;7         if p1 or p3         %?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;
                 ;8         if p7               %?%p7%|%t;8%;
                 m          always              m
                 ^N or ^O   if p9 ^N, else ^O   %?%p9%t^N%e^O%;

       Putting this all together into the sgr sequence gives:

           sgr=\E[0%?%p1%p6%|%t;1%;%?%p2%t;4%;%?%p4%t;5%;
               %?%p1%p3%|%t;7%;%?%p7%t;8%;m%?%p9%t\016%e\017%;,

       Remember that if you specify sgr, you must also  specify  sgr0.   Also,
       some  implementations  rely  on  sgr  being  given  if sgr0 is, Not all
       terminfo  entries  necessarily  have  an  sgr  string,  however.   Many
       terminfo  entries  are  derived  from termcap entries which have no sgr
       string.  The only drawback to adding an sgr string is that termcap also
       assumes that sgr0 does not exit alternate character set mode.

       Terminals   with  the  "magic  cookie"  glitch  (<STRONG>xmc</STRONG>)  deposit  special
       "cookies" when they receive mode-setting sequences,  which  affect  the
       display  algorithm  rather  than  having extra bits for each character.
       Some terminals, such as the HP 2621, automatically leave standout  mode
       when  they  move  to  a  new line or the cursor is addressed.  Programs
       using standout mode should exit standout mode before moving the  cursor
       or  sending a newline, unless the <STRONG>msgr</STRONG> capability, asserting that it is
       safe to move in standout mode, is present.

       If the terminal has a way of flashing the screen to indicate  an  error
       quietly  (a  bell replacement) then this can be given as <STRONG>flash</STRONG>; it must
       not move the cursor.

       If the cursor needs to be made more visible than normal when it is  not
       on the bottom line (to make, for example, a non-blinking underline into
       an easier to find block or blinking underline) give  this  sequence  as
       <STRONG>cvvis</STRONG>.  If there is a way to make the cursor completely invisible, give
       that as <STRONG>civis</STRONG>.  The capability <STRONG>cnorm</STRONG> should be given which  undoes  the
       effects of both of these modes.

       If  your  terminal  correctly  generates underlined characters (with no
       special codes needed) even though it  does  not  overstrike,  then  you
       should  give  the  capability  <STRONG>ul</STRONG>.  If a character overstriking another
       leaves both characters on the screen, specify the  capability  <STRONG>os</STRONG>.   If
       overstrikes are erasable with a blank, then this should be indicated by
       giving <STRONG>eo</STRONG>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Keypad-and-Function-Keys">Keypad and Function Keys</a></H3><PRE>
       If the terminal has a keypad that transmits codes  when  the  keys  are
       pressed,  this  information can be given.  Note that it is not possible
       to handle terminals where the keypad only works in local (this applies,
       for  example, to the unshifted HP 2621 keys).  If the keypad can be set
       to transmit or not  transmit,  give  these  codes  as  <STRONG>smkx</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>rmkx</STRONG>.
       Otherwise the keypad is assumed to always transmit.

       The  codes  sent  by the left arrow, right arrow, up arrow, down arrow,
       and home keys can be given as <STRONG>kcub1,</STRONG> <STRONG>kcuf1,</STRONG>  <STRONG>kcuu1,</STRONG>  <STRONG>kcud1,</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>khome</STRONG>
       respectively.  If there are function keys such as f0, f1, ..., f10, the
       codes they send can be given as <STRONG>kf0,</STRONG> <STRONG>kf1,</STRONG> <STRONG>...,</STRONG>  <STRONG>kf10</STRONG>.   If  these  keys
       have  labels  other  than the default f0 through f10, the labels can be
       given as <STRONG>lf0,</STRONG> <STRONG>lf1,</STRONG> <STRONG>...,</STRONG> <STRONG>lf10</STRONG>.

       The codes transmitted by certain other special keys can be given:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kll</STRONG> (home down),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kbs</STRONG> (backspace),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>ktbc</STRONG> (clear all tabs),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kctab</STRONG> (clear the tab stop in this column),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kclr</STRONG> (clear screen or erase key),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kdch1</STRONG> (delete character),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kdl1</STRONG> (delete line),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>krmir</STRONG> (exit insert mode),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kel</STRONG> (clear to end of line),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>ked</STRONG> (clear to end of screen),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kich1</STRONG> (insert character or enter insert mode),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kil1</STRONG> (insert line),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>knp</STRONG> (next page),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kpp</STRONG> (previous page),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kind</STRONG> (scroll forward/down),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>kri</STRONG> (scroll backward/up),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>khts</STRONG> (set a tab stop in this column).

       In addition, if the keypad has a 3 by 3 array  of  keys  including  the
       four  arrow  keys,  the  other five keys can be given as <STRONG>ka1</STRONG>, <STRONG>ka3</STRONG>, <STRONG>kb2</STRONG>,
       <STRONG>kc1</STRONG>, and <STRONG>kc3</STRONG>.  These keys are useful when the  effects  of  a  3  by  3
       directional pad are needed.

       Strings to program function keys can be given as <STRONG>pfkey</STRONG>, <STRONG>pfloc</STRONG>, and <STRONG>pfx</STRONG>.
       A string to program screen labels should be specified as <STRONG>pln</STRONG>.  Each  of
       these  strings takes two parameters: the function key number to program
       (from 0 to 10) and the string to program it with.  Function key numbers
       out  of  this  range may program undefined keys in a terminal dependent
       manner.  The difference between the capabilities is that  <STRONG>pfkey</STRONG>  causes
       pressing  the  given  key  to  be the same as the user typing the given
       string; <STRONG>pfloc</STRONG> causes the string to  be  executed  by  the  terminal  in
       local; and <STRONG>pfx</STRONG> causes the string to be transmitted to the computer.

       The  capabilities  <STRONG>nlab</STRONG>,  <STRONG>lw</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>lh</STRONG> define the number of programmable
       screen labels and their width and height.  If  there  are  commands  to
       turn  the  labels  on  and  off,  give  them in <STRONG>smln</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmln</STRONG>.  <STRONG>smln</STRONG> is
       normally output after one or more pln sequences to make sure  that  the
       change becomes visible.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Tabs-and-Initialization">Tabs and Initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       A few capabilities are used only for tabs:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  the  terminal  has hardware tabs, the command to advance to the
           next tab stop can be given as <STRONG>ht</STRONG> (usually control/I).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A "back-tab" command which moves leftward to the preceding tab stop
           can be given as <STRONG>cbt</STRONG>.

           By  convention,  if the teletype modes indicate that tabs are being
           expanded by the computer rather than being sent  to  the  terminal,
           programs  should  not use <STRONG>ht</STRONG> or <STRONG>cbt</STRONG> even if they are present, since
           the user may not have the tab stops properly set.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the terminal has hardware tabs which are initially set  every  <EM>n</EM>
           spaces when the terminal is powered up, the numeric parameter <STRONG>it</STRONG> is
           given, showing the number of spaces the tabs are set to.

           The <STRONG>it</STRONG> capability is normally used by the <STRONG>tset</STRONG> command to determine
           whether  to set the mode for hardware tab expansion, and whether to
           set the tab stops.  If the terminal has tab stops that can be saved
           in  non-volatile  memory,  the terminfo description can assume that
           they are properly set.

       Other capabilities include

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>is1</STRONG>, <STRONG>is2</STRONG>, and <STRONG>is3</STRONG>, initialization strings for the terminal,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>iprog</STRONG>, the path name of a program  to  be  run  to  initialize  the
           terminal,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and <STRONG>if</STRONG>, the name of a file containing long initialization strings.

       These  strings  are  expected to set the terminal into modes consistent
       with the rest of the terminfo description.  They are normally  sent  to
       the  terminal,  by  the  <EM>init</EM> option of the <STRONG>tput</STRONG> program, each time the
       user logs in.  They will be printed in the following order:

              run the program
                     <STRONG>iprog</STRONG>

              output
                     <STRONG>is1</STRONG> and
                     <STRONG>is2</STRONG>

              set the margins using
                     <STRONG>mgc</STRONG> or
                     <STRONG>smglp</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgrp</STRONG> or
                     <STRONG>smgl</STRONG> and <STRONG>smgr</STRONG>

              set tabs using
                     <STRONG>tbc</STRONG> and <STRONG>hts</STRONG>

              print the file
                     <STRONG>if</STRONG>

              and finally output
                     <STRONG>is3</STRONG>.

       Most initialization is done with <STRONG>is2</STRONG>.  Special terminal  modes  can  be
       set  up  without duplicating strings by putting the common sequences in
       <STRONG>is2</STRONG> and special cases in <STRONG>is1</STRONG> and <STRONG>is3</STRONG>.

       A set of sequences that does a harder  reset  from  a  totally  unknown
       state can be given as <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs2</STRONG>, <STRONG>rf</STRONG> and <STRONG>rs3</STRONG>, analogous to <STRONG>is1</STRONG> <STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>is2</STRONG> <STRONG>,</STRONG> <STRONG>if</STRONG>
       and <STRONG>is3</STRONG> respectively.  These strings are  output  by  <EM>reset</EM>  option  of
       <STRONG>tput</STRONG>,  or  by  the <STRONG>reset</STRONG> program (an alias of <STRONG>tset</STRONG>), which is used when
       the terminal gets into a wedged state.  Commands are normally placed in
       <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs2</STRONG> <STRONG>rs3</STRONG> and <STRONG>rf</STRONG> only if they produce annoying effects on the screen
       and are not necessary when logging in.  For example, the command to set
       the  vt100  into  80-column  mode would normally be part of <STRONG>is2</STRONG>, but it
       causes an annoying glitch of the screen  and  is  not  normally  needed
       since the terminal is usually already in 80-column mode.

       The  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  program  writes  strings including <STRONG>iprog</STRONG>, etc., in the same
       order as the <EM>init</EM> program, using <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, etc., instead of  <STRONG>is1</STRONG>,  etc.   If
       any  of  <STRONG>rs1</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs2</STRONG>, <STRONG>rs3</STRONG>, or <STRONG>rf</STRONG> reset capability strings are missing, the
       <STRONG>reset</STRONG>  program  falls  back  upon  the   corresponding   initialization
       capability string.

       If  there are commands to set and clear tab stops, they can be given as
       <STRONG>tbc</STRONG> (clear all tab stops) and <STRONG>hts</STRONG> (set a tab stop in the current column
       of  every  line).  If a more complex sequence is needed to set the tabs
       than can be described by this, the sequence can be placed in <STRONG>is2</STRONG> or <STRONG>if</STRONG>.

       The <STRONG>tput</STRONG> <STRONG>reset</STRONG> command uses the same capability strings  as  the  <STRONG>reset</STRONG>
       command,  although  the two programs (<STRONG>tput</STRONG> and <STRONG>reset</STRONG>) provide different
       command-line options.

       In  practice,  these  terminfo  capabilities  are  not  often  used  in
       initialization of tabs (though they are required for the <STRONG>tabs</STRONG> program):

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Almost all hardware terminals (at least those which supported tabs)
           initialized those to every <EM>eight</EM> columns:

           The only exception was the AT&amp;T 2300  series,  which  set  tabs  to
           every <EM>five</EM> columns.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   In  particular,  developers  of  the  hardware  terminals which are
           commonly used as models  for  modern  terminal  emulators  provided
           documentation demonstrating that <EM>eight</EM> columns were the standard.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Because of this, the terminal initialization programs <STRONG>tput</STRONG> and <STRONG>tset</STRONG>
           use  the  <STRONG>tbc</STRONG>  (<STRONG>clear_all_tabs</STRONG>)  and  <STRONG>hts</STRONG>  (<STRONG>set_tab</STRONG>)   capabilities
           directly  only when the <STRONG>it</STRONG> (<STRONG>init_tabs</STRONG>) capability is set to a value
           other than <EM>eight</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Delays-and-Padding">Delays and Padding</a></H3><PRE>
       Many older and slower terminals do not support either XON/XOFF  or  DTR
       handshaking,  including  hard copy terminals and some very archaic CRTs
       (including, for  example,  DEC  VT100s).   These  may  require  padding
       characters after certain cursor motions and screen changes.

       If the terminal uses xon/xoff handshaking for flow control (that is, it
       automatically emits ^S back to the host  when  its  input  buffers  are
       close  to  full),  set <STRONG>xon</STRONG>.  This capability suppresses the emission of
       padding.  You  can  also  set  it  for  memory-mapped  console  devices
       effectively that do not have a speed limit.  Padding information should
       still be included so that routines  can  make  better  decisions  about
       relative costs, but actual pad characters will not be transmitted.

       If <STRONG>pb</STRONG> (padding baud rate) is given, padding is suppressed at baud rates
       below the value of <STRONG>pb</STRONG>.  If the entry has no  padding  baud  rate,  then
       whether padding is emitted or not is completely controlled by <STRONG>xon</STRONG>.

       If  the  terminal requires other than a null (zero) character as a pad,
       then this can be given as <STRONG>pad</STRONG>.  Only the first  character  of  the  <STRONG>pad</STRONG>
       string is used.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Status-Lines">Status Lines</a></H3><PRE>
       Some  terminals  have an extra "status line" which is not normally used
       by software (and thus not counted in the terminal's <STRONG>lines</STRONG> capability).

       The simplest case is a status line which is cursor-addressable but  not
       part of the main scrolling region on the screen; the Heathkit H19 has a
       status line of this kind, as would  a  24-line  VT100  with  a  23-line
       scrolling region set up on initialization.  This situation is indicated
       by the <STRONG>hs</STRONG> capability.

       Some terminals with status lines need special sequences to  access  the
       status  line.  These may be expressed as a string with single parameter
       <STRONG>tsl</STRONG> which takes the cursor to a given zero-origin column on the  status
       line.   The  capability  <STRONG>fsl</STRONG>  must  return  to  the  main-screen cursor
       positions before the last <STRONG>tsl</STRONG>.  You may need to embed the string values
       of  <STRONG>sc</STRONG>  (save  cursor)  and  <STRONG>rc</STRONG>  (restore  cursor)  in  <STRONG>tsl</STRONG>  and <STRONG>fsl</STRONG> to
       accomplish this.

       The status line is normally assumed to be the same width as  the  width
       of  the  terminal.   If  this  is  untrue,  you can specify it with the
       numeric capability <STRONG>wsl</STRONG>.

       A command to erase or blank the status line may be specified as <STRONG>dsl</STRONG>.

       The Boolean capability <STRONG>eslok</STRONG> specifies  that  escape  sequences,  tabs,
       etc., work ordinarily in the status line.

       The  <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation does not yet use any of these capabilities.
       They are documented here in case they ever become important.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Line-Graphics">Line Graphics</a></H3><PRE>
       Many terminals have alternate character sets useful for  forms-drawing.
       Terminfo  and  <STRONG>curses</STRONG>  have  built-in  support  for most of the drawing
       characters supported by the VT100, with some characters from  the  AT&amp;T
       4410v1  added.   This  alternate  character set may be specified by the
       <STRONG>acsc</STRONG> capability.

       A few notes apply to the table itself:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses incorrectly states that the mapping  for  <EM>lantern</EM>  is
           uppercase  "I"  although Unix implementations use the lowercase "i"
           mapping.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The DEC VT100 implemented graphics using  the  alternate  character
           set  feature, temporarily switching <EM>modes</EM> and sending characters in
           the range 0x60 (96) to 0x7e (126) (the <STRONG>acsc</STRONG>  <STRONG>Value</STRONG>  column  in  the
           table).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The AT&amp;T terminal added graphics characters outside that range.

           Some  of  the  characters  within the range do not match the VT100;
           presumably they were used in the AT&amp;T terminal:  <EM>board</EM>  <EM>of</EM>  <EM>squares</EM>
           replaces  the  VT100  <EM>newline</EM> symbol, while <EM>lantern</EM> <EM>symbol</EM> replaces
           the VT100 <EM>vertical</EM> <EM>tab</EM> symbol.  The other VT100 symbols for control
           characters  (<EM>horizontal</EM> <EM>tab</EM>, <EM>carriage</EM> <EM>return</EM> and <EM>line-feed</EM>) are not
           (re)used in curses.

       The best way to define a new device's graphics set is to add  a  column
       to  a  copy of this table for your terminal, giving the character which
       (when emitted between <STRONG>smacs</STRONG>/<STRONG>rmacs</STRONG> switches) will  be  rendered  as  the
       corresponding graphic.  Then read off the VT100/your terminal character
       pairs right to left in sequence; these become the ACSC string.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Color-Handling">Color Handling</a></H3><PRE>
       The curses library functions <STRONG>init_pair</STRONG> and  <STRONG>init_color</STRONG>  manipulate  the
       <EM>color</EM>   <EM>pairs</EM>   and   <EM>color</EM>  <EM>values</EM>  discussed  in  this  section  (see
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_color.3x.html">curs_color(3x)</A></STRONG> for details on these and related functions).

       Most color terminals are either "Tektronix-like" or "HP-like":

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Tektronix-like terminals have a predefined set of <EM>N</EM> colors (where <EM>N</EM>
           is usually 8), and can set character-cell foreground and background
           colors independently, mixing them into <EM>N</EM> * <EM>N</EM> color pairs.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On HP-like  terminals,  the  user  must  set  each  color  pair  up
           separately   (foreground   and  background  are  not  independently
           settable).  Up to <EM>M</EM> color pairs may be set up  from  2*<EM>M</EM>  different
           colors.  ANSI-compatible terminals are Tektronix-like.

       Some basic color capabilities are independent of the color method.  The
       numeric capabilities <STRONG>colors</STRONG> and <STRONG>pairs</STRONG> specify the  maximum  numbers  of
       colors  and  color  pairs that can be displayed simultaneously.  The <STRONG>op</STRONG>
       (original pair) string resets foreground and background colors to their
       default  values  for  the terminal.  The <STRONG>oc</STRONG> string resets all colors or
       color pairs to their default values for the terminal.   Some  terminals
       (including  many  PC  terminal  emulators)  erase screen areas with the
       current background color rather than the power-up  default  background;
       these should have the Boolean capability <STRONG>bce</STRONG>.

       While  the  curses  library  works  with  <EM>color</EM>  <EM>pairs</EM>  (reflecting the
       inability of some devices  to  set  foreground  and  background  colors
       independently),  there  are  separate  capabilities  for  setting these
       features:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   To  change  the  current  foreground  or  background  color  on   a
           Tektronix-type  terminal, use <STRONG>setaf</STRONG> (set ANSI foreground) and <STRONG>setab</STRONG>
           (set ANSI background)  or  <STRONG>setf</STRONG>  (set  foreground)  and  <STRONG>setb</STRONG>  (set
           background).  These take one parameter, the color number.  The SVr4
           documentation describes only <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setab</STRONG>; the XPG4 draft says  that
           "If  the  terminal supports ANSI escape sequences to set background
           and  foreground,  they  should  be  coded  as  <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>   and   <STRONG>setab</STRONG>,
           respectively.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  the  terminal supports other escape sequences to set background
           and  foreground,  they  should  be  coded   as   <STRONG>setf</STRONG>   and   <STRONG>setb</STRONG>,
           respectively.   The  <STRONG>vidputs</STRONG>  and the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_refresh.3x.html">refresh(3x)</A></STRONG> functions use the
           <STRONG>setaf</STRONG> and <STRONG>setab</STRONG> capabilities if they are defined.

       The <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setab</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>setf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setb</STRONG>  capabilities  take  a  single  numeric
       argument each.  Argument values 0-7 of <STRONG>setaf</STRONG>/<STRONG>setab</STRONG> are portably defined
       as follows (the middle column is the symbolic #define available in  the
       header  for the <STRONG>curses</STRONG> or <EM>ncurses</EM> libraries).  The terminal hardware is
       free to map these as it likes,  but  the  RGB  values  indicate  normal
       locations in color space.

       It is important to not confuse the  two  sets  of  color  capabilities;
       otherwise red/blue will be interchanged on the display.

       On  an  HP-like terminal, use <STRONG>scp</STRONG> with a color pair number parameter to
       set which color pair is current.

       Some terminals allow the <EM>color</EM> <EM>values</EM> to be modified:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On a Tektronix-like terminal, the capability <STRONG>ccc</STRONG> may be present  to
           indicate  that colors can be modified.  If so, the <STRONG>initc</STRONG> capability
           will take a color number (0 to <STRONG>colors</STRONG> - 1)and three more parameters
           which  describe the color.  These three parameters default to being
           interpreted as RGB (Red,  Green,  Blue)  values.   If  the  Boolean
           capability <STRONG>hls</STRONG> is present, they are instead as HLS (Hue, Lightness,
           Saturation) indices.  The ranges are terminal-dependent.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   On an HP-like terminal, <STRONG>initp</STRONG> may give a capability for changing  a
           color  pair  value.   It  will  take seven parameters; a color pair
           number (0 to <STRONG>max_pairs</STRONG> -  1),  and  two  triples  describing  first
           background  and  then  foreground colors.  These parameters must be
           (Red, Green, Blue) or (Hue,  Lightness,  Saturation)  depending  on
           <STRONG>hls</STRONG>.

       On  some  color  terminals,  colors  collide  with highlights.  You can
       register these collisions with the <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> capability.  This is a bit  mask
       of   attributes   not   to  be  used  when  colors  are  enabled.   The
       correspondence with the attributes understood by <STRONG>curses</STRONG> is as follows:

                         <STRONG>Attribute</STRONG>     <STRONG>Bit</STRONG>   <STRONG>Decimal</STRONG>   <STRONG>Set</STRONG> <STRONG>by</STRONG>

       For example, on many IBM PC consoles, the underline attribute  collides
       with  the  foreground  color  blue  and is not available in color mode.
       These should have an <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> capability of 2.

       SVr4 curses does nothing with <STRONG>ncv</STRONG>, <EM>ncurses</EM> recognizes it and  optimizes
       the output in favor of colors.

       If  the  terminal requires other than a null (zero) character as a pad,
       then this can be given as pad.  Only the first  character  of  the  pad
       string is used.  If the terminal does not have a pad character, specify
       npc.  Note that <EM>ncurses</EM> implements the termcap-compatible <STRONG>PC</STRONG>  variable;
       though  the  application  may  set this value to something other than a
       null, <EM>ncurses</EM> will test <STRONG>npc</STRONG> first and use napms if the terminal has  no
       pad character.

       If  the terminal can move up or down half a line, this can be indicated
       with <STRONG>hu</STRONG> (half-line up) and <STRONG>hd</STRONG>  (half-line  down).   This  is  primarily
       useful  for  superscripts  and subscripts on hard-copy terminals.  If a
       hard-copy terminal can eject to the next page (form feed), give this as
       <STRONG>ff</STRONG> (usually control/L).

       If  there  is  a  command to repeat a given character a given number of
       times  (to  save  time  transmitting  a  large  number   of   identical
       characters)  this  can  be indicated with the parameterized string <STRONG>rep</STRONG>.
       The first parameter is the character to be repeated and the  second  is
       the number of times to repeat it.  Thus, tparm(repeat_char, 'x', 10) is
       the same as "xxxxxxxxxx".

       If the terminal has a settable command character, such as the TEKTRONIX
       4025,  this can be indicated with <STRONG>cmdch</STRONG>.  A prototype command character
       is chosen which is used in all capabilities.  This character  is  given
       in  the  <STRONG>cmdch</STRONG>  capability to identify it.  The following convention is
       supported on some Unix systems: The environment is to be searched for a
       <STRONG>CC</STRONG>  variable,  and if found, all occurrences of the prototype character
       are replaced with the character in the environment variable.

       Terminal descriptions that do not represent a specific  kind  of  known
       terminal,  such  as  <EM>switch</EM>, <EM>dialup</EM>, <EM>patch</EM>, and <EM>network</EM>, should include
       the <STRONG>gn</STRONG> (generic) capability so that programs can complain that they  do
       not  know how to talk to the terminal.  (This capability does not apply
       to <EM>virtual</EM> terminal descriptions for which  the  escape  sequences  are
       known.)

       If the terminal has a "meta key" which acts as a shift key, setting the
       8th bit of any character transmitted, this fact can be  indicated  with
       <STRONG>km</STRONG>.   Otherwise, software will assume that the 8th bit is parity and it
       will usually be cleared.  If strings exist to turn this "meta mode"  on
       and off, they can be given as <STRONG>smm</STRONG> and <STRONG>rmm</STRONG>.

       If the terminal has more lines of memory than will fit on the screen at
       once, the number of lines of memory can be indicated with <STRONG>lm</STRONG>.  A  value
       of <STRONG>lm</STRONG>#0 indicates that the number of lines is not fixed, but that there
       is still more memory than fits on the screen.

       If the terminal is one of those supported by the Unix virtual  terminal
       protocol, the terminal number can be given as <STRONG>vt</STRONG>.

       Media  copy strings which control an auxiliary printer connected to the
       terminal can be given as <STRONG>mc0</STRONG>: print the contents of  the  screen,  <STRONG>mc4</STRONG>:
       turn  off  the printer, and <STRONG>mc5</STRONG>: turn on the printer.  When the printer
       is on, all text sent to the terminal will be sent to the  printer.   It
       is  undefined whether the text is also displayed on the terminal screen
       when the printer is on.  A variation  <STRONG>mc5p</STRONG>  takes  one  parameter,  and
       leaves  the  printer  on  for  as  many  characters as the value of the
       parameter, then turns the printer off.  The parameter should not exceed
       255.   All  text, including <STRONG>mc4</STRONG>, is transparently passed to the printer
       while an <STRONG>mc5p</STRONG> is in effect.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Glitches-and-Brain-Damage">Glitches and Brain Damage</a></H3><PRE>
       Hazeltine terminals, which do not allow "~" characters to be  displayed
       should indicate <STRONG>hz</STRONG>.

       Terminals  which  ignore a line-feed immediately after an <STRONG>am</STRONG> wrap, such
       as the Concept and vt100, should indicate <STRONG>xenl</STRONG>.

       If <STRONG>el</STRONG> is required to get rid of standout  (instead  of  merely  writing
       normal text on top of it), <STRONG>xhp</STRONG> should be given.

       Teleray terminals, where tabs turn all characters moved over to blanks,
       should indicate <STRONG>xt</STRONG> (destructive tabs).  Note: the  variable  indicating
       this   is   now  "dest_tabs_magic_smso";  in  older  versions,  it  was
       teleray_glitch.  This glitch is also taken  to  mean  that  it  is  not
       possible  to  position  the  cursor on top of a "magic cookie", that to
       erase standout mode it is instead necessary to use  delete  and  insert
       line.  The <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation ignores this glitch.

       The  Beehive Superbee, which is unable to correctly transmit the escape
       or control/C characters, has <STRONG>xsb</STRONG>, indicating that the f1  key  is  used
       for  escape  and  f2  for control/C.  (Only certain Superbees have this
       problem, depending on the ROM.)  Note that in older terminfo  versions,
       this capability was called "beehive_glitch"; it is now "no_esc_ctl_c".

       Other  specific  terminal  problems  may  be  corrected  by adding more
       capabilities of the form <STRONG>x</STRONG><EM>x</EM>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Pitfalls-of-Long-Entries">Pitfalls of Long Entries</a></H3><PRE>
       Long terminfo entries are unlikely to be a problem; to date,  no  entry
       has   even   approached   terminfo's  4096-byte  string-table  maximum.
       Unfortunately, the termcap translations are much more strictly  limited
       (to 1023 bytes), thus termcap translations of long terminfo entries can
       cause problems.

       The man pages for 4.3BSD and older versions  of  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  instruct  the
       user  to  allocate a 1024-byte buffer for the termcap entry.  The entry
       gets null-terminated by the termcap library, so that makes the  maximum
       safe  length  for a termcap entry 1k-1 (1023) bytes.  Depending on what
       the application and the termcap library being used does, and  where  in
       the  termcap  file  the terminal type that <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> is searching for is,
       several bad things can happen:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some termcap libraries print a warning message,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some exit if they find an entry that's longer than 1023 bytes,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some neither exit nor warn, doing nothing useful, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   some simply truncate the entries to 1023 bytes.

       Some application programs allocate more than the recommended 1K for the
       termcap entry; others do not.

       Each  termcap  entry has two important sizes associated with it: before
       "tc" expansion, and after "tc" expansion.  "tc" is the capability  that
       tacks on another termcap entry to the end of the current one, to add on
       its capabilities.  If a termcap entry does not use the "tc" capability,
       then of course the two lengths are the same.

       The  "before tc expansion" length is the most important one, because it
       affects more than just users of that particular terminal.  This is  the
       length  of the entry as it exists in /etc/termcap, minus the backslash-
       newline pairs, which <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> strips out while reading it.  Some termcap
       libraries strip off the final newline, too (GNU termcap does not).  Now
       suppose:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a termcap entry before expansion is more than 1023 bytes long,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and the application has only allocated a 1k buffer,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and the termcap library (like the one in BSD/OS 1.1 and GNU)  reads
           the  whole entry into the buffer, no matter what its length, to see
           if it is the entry it wants,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   and <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> is searching for a terminal type  that  either  is  the
           long  entry,  appears  in the termcap file after the long entry, or
           does not appear in the file at all (so that <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> has  to  search
           the whole termcap file).

       Then  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  will  overwrite  memory, perhaps its stack, and probably
       core  dump  the  program.   Programs  like  telnet   are   particularly
       vulnerable;  modern  telnets  pass  along values like the terminal type
       automatically.  The results are almost as undesirable  with  a  termcap
       library,  like SunOS 4.1.3 and Ultrix 4.4, that prints warning messages
       when it reads an overly long  termcap  entry.   If  a  termcap  library
       truncates  long entries, like OSF/1 3.0, it is immune to dying here but
       will return incorrect data for the terminal.

       The "after tc expansion" length will  have  a  similar  effect  to  the
       above, but only for people who actually set <EM>TERM</EM> to that terminal type,
       since <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> only does "tc" expansion once it is  found  the  terminal
       type it was looking for, not while searching.

       In  summary,  a termcap entry that is longer than 1023 bytes can cause,
       on various combinations of termcap libraries and applications,  a  core
       dump,  warnings, or incorrect operation.  If it is too long even before
       "tc" expansion, it will have this effect even for users of  some  other
       terminal  types  and  users whose <EM>TERM</EM> variable does not have a termcap
       entry.

       When in -C (translate to termcap) mode, the <EM>ncurses</EM>  implementation  of
       <STRONG><A HREF="tic.1m.html">tic(1m)</A></STRONG>  issues  warning  messages  when the pre-tc length of a termcap
       translation is too long.  The -c (check) option  also  checks  resolved
       (after tc expansion) lengths.

       Searching    for   terminal   descriptions   in   <EM>$HOME/.terminfo</EM>   and
       <EM>TERMINFO</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>DIRS</EM> is not supported by older implementations.

       Some SVr4 <STRONG>curses</STRONG> implementations, and all  previous  to  SVr4,  do  not
       interpret the %A and %O operators in parameter strings.

       SVr4/XPG4  do  not  specify  whether <STRONG>msgr</STRONG> licenses movement while in an
       alternate-character-set mode (such modes may, among other  things,  map
       CR  and  NL  to  characters  that  do  not trigger local motions).  The
       <EM>ncurses</EM> implementation ignores <STRONG>msgr</STRONG> in <STRONG>ALTCHARSET</STRONG>  mode.   This  raises
       the  possibility  that  an  XPG4  implementation  making  the  opposite
       interpretation may need terminfo entries made for <EM>ncurses</EM> to have  <STRONG>msgr</STRONG>
       turned off.

       The <EM>ncurses</EM> library handles insert-character and insert-character modes
       in a slightly non-standard way to get better  update  efficiency.   See
       the <STRONG>Insert/Delete</STRONG> <STRONG>Character</STRONG> subsection above.

       The  parameter  substitutions  for  <STRONG>set_clock</STRONG> and <STRONG>display_clock</STRONG> are not
       documented in SVr4  or  X/Open  Curses.   They  are  deduced  from  the
       documentation for the AT&amp;T 505 terminal.

       Be  careful  assigning the <STRONG>kmous</STRONG> capability.  The <EM>ncurses</EM> library wants
       to interpret it as <STRONG>KEY_MOUSE</STRONG>, for use by terminals and  emulators  like
       xterm  that can return mouse-tracking information in the keyboard-input
       stream.

       X/Open Curses does not mention  italics.   Portable  applications  must
       assume  that  numeric  capabilities  are  signed  16-bit  values.  This
       includes the <EM>no</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>color</EM><STRONG>_</STRONG><EM>video</EM> (<STRONG>ncv</STRONG>) capability.   The  32768  mask  value
       used  for  italics  with <STRONG>ncv</STRONG> can be confused with an absent or canceled
       <STRONG>ncv</STRONG>.  If italics should work with colors, then the <STRONG>ncv</STRONG>  value  must  be
       specified, even if it is zero.

       Different  commercial  ports  of  <EM>terminfo</EM> and <EM>curses</EM> support different
       subsets of X/Open Curses and  (in  some  cases)  different  extensions.
       Here  is  a  summary,  accurate  as  of  October  1995, after which the
       commercial Unix market contracted and lost diversity.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr4, Solaris, and <EM>ncurses</EM> support all SVr4 capabilities.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   IRIX supports the SVr4  set  and  adds  one  undocumented  extended
           string capability (<STRONG>set_pglen</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   SVr1   and   Ultrix   support   a  restricted  subset  of  <EM>terminfo</EM>
           capabilities.  The Booleans end with <STRONG>xon_xoff</STRONG>;  the  numerics  with
           <STRONG>width_status_line</STRONG>; and the strings with <STRONG>prtr_non</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   HP/UX   supports  the  SVr1  subset,  plus  the  SVr[234]  numerics
           <STRONG>num_labels</STRONG>,  <STRONG>label_height</STRONG>,  <STRONG>label_width</STRONG>,  plus  function  keys   11
           through  63, plus <STRONG>plab_norm</STRONG>, <STRONG>label_on</STRONG>, and <STRONG>label_off</STRONG>, plus a number
           of incompatible string table extensions.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   AIX supports the SVr1 subset, plus function  keys  11  through  63,
           plus a number of incompatible string table extensions.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   OSF/1 supports both the SVr4 set and the AIX extensions.
