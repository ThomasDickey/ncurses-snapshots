       <B>clear</B> - clear the terminal screen

       <B>clear</B> [<B>-T</B><I>type</I>] [<B>-V</B>] [<B>-x</B>]


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <B>clear</B>  clears your screen if this is possible, including its scrollback
       buffer (if the extended "E3" capability is defined).   <B>clear</B>  looks  in
       the environment for the terminal type given by the environment variable
       <B>TERM</B>, and then in the <B>terminfo</B> database to determine how to  clear  the
       screen.

       <B>clear</B>  writes  to  the  standard output.  You can redirect the standard
       output to a file (which  prevents  <B>clear</B>  from  actually  clearing  the
       screen),  and  later  <B>cat</B>  the  file to the screen, clearing it at that
       point.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-OPTIONS">OPTIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       <B>-T</B> <I>type</I>
            indicates  the  <I>type</I>  of  terminal.   Normally  this   option   is
            unnecessary,  because  the  default  is taken from the environment
            variable <B>TERM</B>.  If <B>-T</B> is specified, then the shell variables <B>LINES</B>
            and <B>COLUMNS</B> will also be ignored.

       <B>-V</B>   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.  The options are as follows:

       <B>-x</B>   do not attempt to clear the terminal's scrollback buffer using the
            extended "E3" capability.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       A  <B>clear</B>  command  appeared  in 2.79BSD dated February 24, 1979.  Later
       that was provided in Unix 8th edition (1985).

       AT&amp;T adapted a different BSD program  (<B>tset</B>)  to  make  a  new  command
       (<B>tput</B>),  and used this to replace the <B>clear</B> command with a shell script
       which calls <B>tput</B> <B>clear</B>, e.g.,

           /usr/bin/tput ${1:+-T$1} clear 2&gt; /dev/null
           exit

       In 1989, when Keith Bostic revised the BSD  <B>tput</B>  command  to  make  it
       similar  to  the  AT&amp;T  <B>tput</B>,  he  added  a  shell script for the <B>clear</B>
       command:

           exec tput clear

       The remainder of the script in each case is a copyright notice.

       The ncurses <B>clear</B> command began in 1995 by adapting  the  original  BSD
       <B>clear</B> command (with terminfo, of course).

       The <B>E3</B> extension came later:

       <B>o</B>   In  June  1999, xterm provided an extension to the standard control
           sequence for clearing the screen.  Rather than  clearing  just  the
           visible part of the screen using

               printf '\033[2J'

           one could clear the <I>scrollback</I> using

               printf '\033[<B>3</B>J'

           This  is  documented  in  <I>XTerm</I>  <I>Control</I>  <I>Sequences</I>  as  a  feature
           originating with xterm.

       <B>o</B>   A few other terminal developers adopted the feature, e.g., PuTTY in
           2006.

       <B>o</B>   In  April  2011, a Red Hat developer submitted a patch to the Linux
           kernel, modifying its console driver to do  the  same  thing.   The
           Linux  change,  part  of  the  3.0  release, did not mention xterm,
           although it was cited in the Red Hat bug report (#683733) which led
           to the change.

       <B>o</B>   Again,  a  few  other terminal developers adopted the feature.  But
           the next relevant step was a change to the <B>clear</B> program in 2013 to
           incorporate this extension.

       <B>o</B>   In  2013,  the <B>E3</B> extension was overlooked in <B>tput</B> with the "clear"
           parameter.  That was addressed in  2016  by  reorganizing  <B>tput</B>  to
           share its logic with <B>clear</B> and <B>tset</B>.

       Neither IEEE Std 1003.1/The Open  Group  Base  Specifications  Issue  7
       (POSIX.1-2008) nor X/Open Curses Issue 7 documents tset or reset.

       The latter documents <B>tput</B>, which could be used to replace this  utility
       either  via  a shell script or by an alias (such as a symbolic link) to
       run <B>tput</B> as <B>clear</B>.
