</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       These routines are included as a conversion aid for programs  that  use
       the  <I>termcap</I>  library.  Their parameters are the same, but the routines
       are emulated using the <I>terminfo</I> database.  Thus, they can only be  used
       to  query  the  capabilities  of entries for which a terminfo entry has
       been compiled.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-INITIALIZATION">INITIALIZATION</a></H3><PRE>
       The <B>tgetent</B> routine loads the entry for <I>name</I>.  It returns:

          1  on success,

          0  if there is no such entry (or that it is a generic  type,  having
             too little information for curses applications to run), and

          -1 if the terminfo database could not be found.

       This differs from the <I>termcap</I> library in two ways:

          <B>o</B>   The  emulation  ignores  the buffer pointer <I>bp</I>.  The <I>termcap</I> li-
              brary would store a copy of the terminal description in the area
              referenced  by this pointer.  However, ncurses stores its termi-
              nal descriptions in compiled binary form, which is not the  same
              thing.

          <B>o</B>   There is a difference in return codes.  The <I>termcap</I> library does
              not check if the terminal description is marked with the <I>generic</I>
              capability,  or  if the terminal description has cursor-address-
              ing.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-CAPABILITY-VALUES">CAPABILITY VALUES</a></H3><PRE>
       The <B>tgetflag</B> routine gets the boolean entry for <I>id</I>, or zero  if  it  is
       not available.

       The  <B>tgetnum</B>  routine gets the numeric entry for <I>id</I>, or -1 if it is not
       available.

       The <B>tgetstr</B> routine returns the string entry for <I>id</I>, or zero if  it  is
       not  available.  Use <B>tputs</B> to output the returned string.  The <I>area</I> pa-
       rameter is used as follows:

          <B>o</B>   It is assumed to be the address of a pointer to a buffer managed
              by the calling application.

          <B>o</B>   However, ncurses checks to ensure that <B>area</B> is not NULL, and al-
              so that the resulting buffer pointer is  not  NULL.   If  either
              check fails, the <I>area</I> parameter is ignored.

          <B>o</B>   If  the  checks succeed, ncurses also copies the return value to
              the buffer pointed to by <I>area</I>, and the <I>area</I> value will be updat-
              ed to point past the null ending this value.

          <B>o</B>   The  return  value itself is an address in the terminal descrip-
              tion which is loaded into memory.

       Only the first two characters of the <B>id</B> parameter of <B>tgetflag</B>,  <B>tgetnum</B>
       and <B>tgetstr</B> are compared in lookups.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-FORMATTING-CAPABILITIES">FORMATTING CAPABILITIES</a></H3><PRE>
       The <B>tgoto</B> routine expands the given capability using the parameters.

       <B>o</B>   Because  the  capability may have padding characters, the output of
           <B>tgoto</B> should be passed to <B>tputs</B> rather than some other output func-
           tion such as <B>printf</B>.

       <B>o</B>   While  <B>tgoto</B> is assumed to be used for the two-parameter cursor po-
           sitioning capability, termcap applications also use it for  single-
           parameter capabilities.

           Doing this shows a quirk in <B>tgoto</B>: most hardware terminals use cur-
           sor addressing with <I>row</I> first, but the original developers  of  the
           termcap  interface  chose  to  put the <I>column</I> parameter first.  The
           <B>tgoto</B> function swaps the order of parameters.  It  does  this  also
           for  calls  requiring  only  a single parameter.  In that case, the
           first parameter is merely a placeholder.

       <B>o</B>   Normally the ncurses library is compiled with terminfo support.  In
           that case, <B>tgoto</B> uses <B><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3X.html">tparm(3X)</A></B> (a more capable formatter).

           However,  <B>tparm</B>  is not a <I>termcap</I> feature, and portable <I>termcap</I> ap-
           plications should not rely upon its availability.

       The <B>tputs</B> routine is described on the  <B><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3X.html">curs_terminfo(3X)</A></B>  manual  page.
       It can retrieve capabilities by either termcap or terminfo name.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-GLOBAL-VARIABLES">GLOBAL VARIABLES</a></H3><PRE>
       The  variables <B>PC</B>, <B>UP</B> and <B>BC</B> are set by <B>tgetent</B> to the terminfo entry's
       data for <B>pad_char</B>, <B>cursor_up</B> and <B>backspace_if_not_bs</B>, respectively.  <B>UP</B>
       is  not used by ncurses.  <B>PC</B> is used in the <B>tdelay_output</B> function.  <B>BC</B>
       is used in the <B>tgoto</B> emulation.  The variable <B>ospeed</B> is set by  ncurses
       in a system-specific coding to reflect the terminal speed.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       Except  where  explicitly noted, routines that return an integer return
       <B>ERR</B> upon failure and <B>OK</B> (SVr4 only specifies "an  integer  value  other
       than <B>ERR</B>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <B>NULL</B> on error.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-BUGS">BUGS</a></H2><PRE>
       If  you  call <B>tgetstr</B> to fetch <B>ca</B> or any other parameterized string, be
       aware that it will be returned in terminfo notation, not the older  and
       not-quite-compatible termcap notation.  This will not cause problems if
       all you do with it is call <B>tgoto</B> or <B>tparm</B>, which both expand  terminfo-
       style  strings as terminfo.  (The <B>tgoto</B> function, if configured to sup-
       port termcap, will check if the  string  is  indeed  terminfo-style  by
       looking  for  "%p"  parameters or "$&lt;..&gt;" delays, and invoke a termcap-
       style parser if the string does not appear to be terminfo).

       Because terminfo conventions for representing padding in  string  capa-
       bilities differ from termcap's, users can be surprised:

       <B>o</B>   <B>tputs("50")</B> in a terminfo system will put out a literal "50" rather
           than busy-waiting for 50 milliseconds.

       <B>o</B>   However, if ncurses is configured to support termcap, it  may  also
           have been configured to support the BSD-style padding.

           In that case, <B>tputs</B> inspects strings passed to it, looking for dig-
           its at the beginning of the string.

           <B>tputs("50")</B> in a termcap system may wait for 50 milliseconds rather
           than put out a literal "50"

       Note  that termcap has nothing analogous to terminfo's <B>sgr</B> string.  One
       consequence of this is that termcap applications  assume  <B>me</B>  (terminfo
       <B>sgr0</B>)  does not reset the alternate character set.  This implementation
       checks for, and modifies the data shown to the termcap interface to ac-
       commodate termcap's limitation in this respect.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Standards">Standards</a></H3><PRE>
       These  functions  are  provided for supporting legacy applications, and
       should not be used in new programs:

       <B>o</B>   The XSI Curses standard, Issue 4 describes these functions.  Howev-
           er,  they  are  marked TO BE WITHDRAWN and may be removed in future
           versions.

       <B>o</B>   X/Open Curses, Issue 5 (December 2007) marked the termcap interface
           (along with <B>vwprintw</B> and <B>vwscanw</B>) as withdrawn.

       Neither  the  XSI Curses standard nor the SVr4 man pages documented the
       return values of <B>tgetent</B> correctly, though all three were in  fact  re-
       turned  ever  since SVr1.  In particular, an omission in the XSI Curses
       documentation has been misinterpreted to mean that <B>tgetent</B>  returns  <B>OK</B>
       or  <B>ERR</B>.  Because the purpose of these functions is to provide compati-
       bility with the <I>termcap</I> library, that is a defect in XCurses, Issue  4,
       Version 2 rather than in ncurses.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Compatibility-with-BSD-Termcap">Compatibility with BSD Termcap</a></H3><PRE>
       External variables are provided for support of certain termcap applica-
       tions.  However, termcap applications' use of those variables is poorly
       documented, e.g., not distinguishing between input and output.  In par-
       ticular, some applications are reported to declare  and/or  modify  <B>os-</B>
       <B>peed</B>.

       The  comment that only the first two characters of the <B>id</B> parameter are
       used escapes many application developers.  The original BSD 4.2 termcap
       library (and historical relics thereof) did not require a trailing null
       NUL on the parameter name passed  to  <B>tgetstr</B>,  <B>tgetnum</B>  and  <B>tgetflag</B>.
       Some  applications  assume  that the termcap interface does not require
       the trailing NUL for the parameter name.  Taking into account these is-
       sues:

       <B>o</B>   As  a  special  case,  <B>tgetflag</B>  matched against a single-character
           identifier provided that was at the end of  the  terminal  descrip-
           tion.  You should not rely upon this behavior in portable programs.
           This implementation disallows matches against single-character  ca-
           pability names.

       <B>o</B>   This  implementation  disallows  matches  by  the termcap interface
           against extended capability names which are longer than two charac-
           ters.

       The BSD termcap function <B>tgetent</B> returns the text of a termcap entry in
       the buffer passed as an argument.  This library  (like  other  terminfo
       implementations) does not store terminal descriptions as text.  It sets
       the buffer contents to a null-terminated string.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Other-Compatibility">Other Compatibility</a></H3><PRE>
       This library includes a termcap.h header, for compatibility with  other
       implementations.   But  the header is rarely used because the other im-
       plementations are not strictly compatible.

       The original BSD termcap (through 4.3BSD) had no header file which gave
       function prototypes, because that was a feature of ANSI C.  BSD termcap
       was written several years before C was  standardized.   However,  there
       were two different termcap.h header files in the BSD sources:

       <B>o</B>   One  was used internally by the <I>jove</I> editor in 2BSD through 4.4BSD.
           It defined global symbols for the termcap variables which it used.

       <B>o</B>   The other appeared in 4.4BSD Lite Release 2 (mid-1993) as  part  of
           <I>libedit</I> (also known as the <I>editline</I> library).  The CSRG source his-
           tory shows that this was added in  mid-1992.   The  <I>libedit</I>  header
           file  was used internally, as a convenience for compiling the <I>edit-</I>
           <I>line</I> library.  It declared function prototypes, but no global vari-
           ables.

       The  header  file from <I>libedit</I> was added to NetBSD's termcap library in
       mid-1994.

       Meanwhile, GNU termcap was under development, starting  in  1990.   The
       first  release  (termcap 1.0) in 1991 included a termcap.h header.  The
       second release (termcap 1.1) in September 1992 modified the  header  to
       use <B>const</B> for the function prototypes in the header where one would ex-
       pect the parameters to be read-only.  This was a difference versus  the
       original  BSD  termcap.   The prototype for <B>tputs</B> also differed, but in
       that instance, it was <I>libedit</I> which differed from BSD termcap.

       A copy of GNU termcap 1.3 was bundled with <I>bash</I> in mid-1993, to support
       the <I>readline</I> library.

       A  termcap.h  file was provided in ncurses 1.8.1 (November 1993).  That
       reflected influence by <I>emacs</I> (rather than <I>jove</I>) and GNU termcap:

       <B>o</B>   it provided declarations for a few global symbols used by <I>emacs</I>

       <B>o</B>   it provided function prototypes (using <B>const</B>).

       <B>o</B>   a prototype for <B>tparam</B> (a GNU termcap feature) was provided.

       Later (in mid-1996) the <B>tparam</B> function was removed from ncurses.  As a
       result,  there are differences between any of the four implementations,
       which must be taken into account by programs which can  work  with  all
       termcap library interfaces.
