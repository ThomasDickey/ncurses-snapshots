</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       These routines are included as a conversion aid for programs  that  use
       the  <EM>termcap</EM>  library.  Their parameters are the same, but the routines
       are emulated using the <EM>terminfo</EM> database.  Thus, they can only be  used
       to  query  the  capabilities  of entries for which a terminfo entry has
       been compiled.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Initialization">Initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> routine loads the entry for <EM>name</EM>.  It returns:

          1  on success,

          0  if there is no such entry (or that it is a generic  type,  having
             too little information for curses applications to run), and

          -1 if the terminfo database could not be found.

       This differs from the <EM>termcap</EM> library in two ways:

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  emulation  ignores  the  buffer  pointer  <EM>bp</EM>.   The <EM>termcap</EM>
              library would store a copy of the terminal  description  in  the
              area  referenced  by  this pointer.  However, ncurses stores its
              terminal descriptions in compiled binary form, which is not  the
              same thing.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   There is a difference in return codes.  The <EM>termcap</EM> library does
              not check if the terminal description is marked with the <EM>generic</EM>
              capability,   or   if   the  terminal  description  has  cursor-
              addressing.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Capability-Values">Capability Values</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG> routine gets the boolean entry for <EM>id</EM>, or zero  if  it  is
       not available.

       The  <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG>  routine gets the numeric entry for <EM>id</EM>, or -1 if it is not
       available.

       The <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> routine returns the string entry for <EM>id</EM>, or zero if  it  is
       not  available.   Use  <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  to  output the returned string.  The <EM>area</EM>
       parameter is used as follows:

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   It is assumed to be the address of a pointer to a buffer managed
              by the calling application.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   However,  ncurses  checks  to  ensure that <STRONG>area</STRONG> is not NULL, and
              also that the resulting buffer pointer is not NULL.   If  either
              check fails, the <EM>area</EM> parameter is ignored.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If  the  checks succeed, ncurses also copies the return value to
              the buffer pointed to by  <EM>area</EM>,  and  the  <EM>area</EM>  value  will  be
              updated to point past the null ending this value.

          <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The   return   value  itself  is  an  address  in  the  terminal
              description which is loaded into memory.

       Only the first two characters of the <STRONG>id</STRONG> parameter of <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG>,  <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG>
       and <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> are compared in lookups.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Formatting-Capabilities">Formatting Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       The <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> routine expands the given capability using the parameters.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Because  the  capability may have padding characters, the output of
           <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> should be passed to  <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  rather  than  some  other  output
           function such as <STRONG>printf(3)</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   While  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  is  assumed  to  be used for the two-parameter cursor
           positioning  capability,  termcap  applications  also  use  it  for
           single-parameter capabilities.

           Doing  this  shows  a  quirk  in <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>: most hardware terminals use
           cursor addressing with <EM>row</EM> first, but the  original  developers  of
           the termcap interface chose to put the <EM>column</EM> parameter first.  The
           <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> function swaps the order of parameters.  It  does  this  also
           for  calls  requiring  only  a single parameter.  In that case, the
           first parameter is merely a placeholder.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Normally the ncurses library is compiled with terminfo support.  In
           that  case,  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  uses  an  internal version of <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG> (a more
           capable formatter).

           With terminfo support, <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> is able to use some  of  the  terminfo
           features,  but  not  all.   In  particular,  it allows only numeric
           parameters; <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> supports string parameters.

           However, <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> is not  a  <EM>termcap</EM>  feature,  and  portable  <EM>termcap</EM>
           applications should not rely upon its availability.

       The  <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  routine  is described on the <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">curs_terminfo(3x)</A></STRONG> manual page.
       It can retrieve capabilities by either termcap or terminfo name.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Global-Variables">Global Variables</a></H3><PRE>
       The variables <STRONG>PC</STRONG>, <STRONG>UP</STRONG> and <STRONG>BC</STRONG> are set by <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> to the terminfo  entry's
       data for <STRONG>pad_char</STRONG>, <STRONG>cursor_up</STRONG> and <STRONG>backspace_if_not_bs</STRONG>, respectively.  <STRONG>UP</STRONG>
       is not used by ncurses.  <STRONG>PC</STRONG> is used in the <STRONG>tdelay_output</STRONG> function.   <STRONG>BC</STRONG>
       is  used in the <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> emulation.  The variable <STRONG>ospeed</STRONG> is set by ncurses
       in a system-specific coding to reflect the terminal speed.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Releasing-Memory">Releasing Memory</a></H3><PRE>
       The termcap functions provide no  means  for  freeing  memory,  because
       legacy  termcap  implementations used only the buffer areas provided by
       the caller via <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  and  <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>.   Those  buffers  are  unused  in
       terminfo.

       On  the  other  hand,  terminfo allocates memory.  It uses <STRONG>setupterm</STRONG> to
       retrieve the data used  by  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  and  the  functions  which  return
       capability values such as <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>.  One could use

               <STRONG>del_curterm(cur_term);</STRONG>


       to  free  this  memory,  but  there  is an additional complication with
       ncurses.  It uses a fixed-size  <EM>pool</EM>  of  storage  locations,  one  per
       setting  of  the  <STRONG>TERM</STRONG>  variable when <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> is called.  The <STRONG>screen(1)</STRONG>
       program relies upon this arrangement, to improve its performance.

       An application which uses only the low-level  termcap  functions  could
       free  the  memory  using  <STRONG>del_curterm</STRONG>,  because the pool is freed using
       other functions (see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_memleaks.3x.html">curs_memleaks(3x)</A></STRONG>).


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       Except where explicitly noted, routines that return an  integer  return
       <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>  upon  failure  and <STRONG>OK</STRONG> (SVr4 only specifies "an integer value other
       than <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>") upon successful completion.

       Routines that return pointers return <STRONG>NULL</STRONG> on error.

       A few special cases apply:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the terminal database has not been initialized, these return  an
           error.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  calls  with  a  string  parameter  (<STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>, <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>) check if the
           string is null, or cancelled.  Those return an error.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A call to <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> using a capability with  string  parameters  is  an
           error.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   A call to <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> using a capability with more than two parameters is
           an error.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Standards">Standards</a></H3><PRE>
       These functions are provided for supporting  legacy  applications,  and
       should not be used in new programs:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  XSI  Curses  standard,  Issue  4  describes  these  functions.
           However, they are marked TO BE WITHDRAWN  and  may  be  removed  in
           future versions.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   X/Open Curses, Issue 5 (December 2007) marked the termcap interface
           (along with <STRONG>vwprintw</STRONG> and <STRONG>vwscanw</STRONG>) as withdrawn.

       Neither the XSI Curses standard nor the SVr4 man pages  documented  the
       return  values  of  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  correctly,  though  all three were in fact
       returned ever since SVr1.  In particular, an omission in the XSI Curses
       documentation  has  been misinterpreted to mean that <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> returns <STRONG>OK</STRONG>
       or  <STRONG>ERR</STRONG>.   Because  the  purpose  of  these  functions  is  to  provide
       compatibility  with  the  <EM>termcap</EM> library, that is a defect in XCurses,
       Issue 4, Version 2 rather than in ncurses.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Compatibility-with-BSD-Termcap">Compatibility with BSD Termcap</a></H3><PRE>
       External  variables  are  provided  for  support  of  certain   termcap
       applications.  However, termcap applications' use of those variables is
       poorly documented, e.g., not distinguishing between input  and  output.
       In  particular, some applications are reported to declare and/or modify
       <STRONG>ospeed</STRONG>.

       The comment that only the first two characters of the <STRONG>id</STRONG> parameter  are
       used escapes many application developers.  The original BSD 4.2 termcap
       library (and historical relics thereof) did not require a trailing null
       NUL  on  the  parameter  name  passed to <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>, <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG> and <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG>.
       Some applications assume that the termcap interface  does  not  require
       the  trailing  NUL  for  the parameter name.  Taking into account these
       issues:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   As a special case,  <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG>  matched  against  a  single-character
           identifier   provided   that   was  at  the  end  of  the  terminal
           description.  You should not rely upon this  behavior  in  portable
           programs.   This  implementation  disallows matches against single-
           character capability names.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   This implementation disallows  matches  by  the  termcap  interface
           against  extended  capability  names  which  are  longer  than  two
           characters.

       The BSD termcap function <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> returns the text of a termcap entry in
       the  buffer  passed  as an argument.  This library (like other terminfo
       implementations) does not store terminal descriptions as text.  It sets
       the buffer contents to a null-terminated string.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Other-Compatibility">Other Compatibility</a></H3><PRE>
       This  library includes a termcap.h header, for compatibility with other
       implementations.  But the header  is  rarely  used  because  the  other
       implementations are not strictly compatible.

       The original BSD termcap (through 4.3BSD) had no header file which gave
       function prototypes, because that was a feature of ANSI C.  BSD termcap
       was  written  several  years before C was standardized.  However, there
       were two different termcap.h header files in the BSD sources:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   One was used internally by the <STRONG>jove</STRONG> editor in 2BSD through  4.4BSD.
           It defined global symbols for the termcap variables which it used.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  other  appeared in 4.4BSD Lite Release 2 (mid-1993) as part of
           <EM>libedit</EM> (also known as the  <EM>editline</EM>  library).   The  CSRG  source
           history  shows that this was added in mid-1992.  The <EM>libedit</EM> header
           file was used  internally,  as  a  convenience  for  compiling  the
           <EM>editline</EM>  library.   It declared function prototypes, but no global
           variables.

       The header file from <EM>libedit</EM> was added to NetBSD's termcap  library  in
       mid-1994.

       Meanwhile,  GNU  termcap  was under development, starting in 1990.  The
       first release (termcap 1.0) in 1991 included a termcap.h  header.   The
       second  release  (termcap 1.1) in September 1992 modified the header to
       use <STRONG>const</STRONG> for the function prototypes in the  header  where  one  would
       expect  the  parameters  to be read-only.  This was a difference versus
       the original BSD termcap.  The prototype for <STRONG>tputs</STRONG> also  differed,  but
       in that instance, it was <EM>libedit</EM> which differed from BSD termcap.

       A copy of GNU termcap 1.3 was bundled with <EM>bash</EM> in mid-1993, to support
       the <STRONG>readline(3)</STRONG> library.

       A termcap.h file was provided in ncurses 1.8.1 (November  1993).   That
       reflected influence by <STRONG>emacs(1)</STRONG> (rather than <STRONG>jove(1)</STRONG>) and GNU termcap:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   it provided declarations for a few global symbols used by <STRONG>emacs</STRONG>

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   it provided function prototypes (using <STRONG>const</STRONG>).

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a prototype for <STRONG>tparam</STRONG> (a GNU termcap feature) was provided.

       Later (in mid-1996) the <STRONG>tparam</STRONG> function was removed from ncurses.  As a
       result, there are differences between any of the four  implementations,
       which  must  be  taken into account by programs which can work with all
       termcap library interfaces.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-BUGS">BUGS</a></H2><PRE>
       If you call <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> to fetch  <STRONG>ca</STRONG>  or  any  other  parameterized  string
       capability,  be aware that it is returned in <EM>terminfo</EM> notation, not the
       older and not-quite-compatible <EM>termcap</EM> notation.  This does  not  cause
       problems  if  all  you  do  with  it is call <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> or <STRONG>tparm</STRONG>, which both
       expand <EM>terminfo</EM>-style strings as <EM>terminfo</EM> does.  (The  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  function,
       if  configured  to  support  <EM>termcap,</EM>  checks  if  the string is indeed
       <EM>terminfo</EM>-style by looking for "<STRONG>%p</STRONG>" parameters or  "<STRONG>&lt;</STRONG>...<STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>"  delays,  and
       invokes  a  <EM>termcap</EM>-style  parser  if  the  string  appears  not to use
       <EM>terminfo</EM> syntax.)

       Because <EM>terminfo</EM>'s syntax for padding in  string  capabilities  differs
       from <EM>termcap</EM>'s, users can be surprised.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>tputs("50")</STRONG>  in  a <EM>terminfo</EM> system transmits "50" rather than busy-
           waiting for 50 milliseconds.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   However, if <EM>ncurses</EM> is configured to support <EM>termcap</EM>, it  may  also
           have been configured to support BSD-style padding.

           In  that  case,  <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  inspects  strings passed to it, looking for
           digits at the beginning of the string.

           <STRONG>tputs("50")</STRONG> in a <EM>termcap</EM> system may busy-wait for  50  milliseconds
           rather than transmitting "50".

       <EM>termcap</EM>   has   nothing   analogous  to  <EM>terminfo</EM>'s  <STRONG>sgr</STRONG>  string.   One
       consequence is that <EM>termcap</EM> applications assume that <STRONG>me</STRONG> (equivalent  to
