</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  provides  the  foregoing  variables   and   functions   as   a
       compatibility layer for programs that use the <EM>termcap</EM> library.  The API
       is the same, but behavior is  emulated  using  the  <EM>terminfo</EM>  database.
       Thus,  it  can  be  used  only  to  query  the capabilities of terminal
       database entries for which a <EM>terminfo</EM> entry has been compiled.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Initialization">Initialization</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> loads the terminal database entry for <EM>name</EM>; see <STRONG><A HREF="term.7.html">term(7)</A></STRONG>.   This
       must be done before calling any of the other functions.  It returns

          <STRONG>1</STRONG>    on success,

          <STRONG>0</STRONG>    if there is no such entry (or if the matching entry describes a
               generic terminal, having  too  little  information  for  <EM>curses</EM>
               applications to run), and

          <STRONG>-1</STRONG>   if the <EM>terminfo</EM> database could not be found.

       This implementation differs from those of historical <EM>termcap</EM> libraries.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>ncurses</EM>  ignores  the  buffer  pointer  <EM>bp</EM>,  as  do  other  <EM>termcap</EM>
           implementations  conforming  to  portions  of  X/Open  Curses   now
           withdrawn.   The  BSD  <EM>termcap</EM>  library  would  store a copy of the
           terminal type description in the buffer referenced by this pointer.
           <EM>terminfo</EM>  stores terminal type descriptions in compiled form, which
           is not the same thing.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The meanings of the return values differ.  The BSD <EM>termcap</EM>  library
           does  not  check whether the terminal type description includes the
           <STRONG>generic</STRONG> (<STRONG>gn</STRONG>) capability, nor whether the terminal type  description
           supports an addressable cursor, a property essential for any <EM>curses</EM>
           implementation to operate.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Retrieving-Capability-Values">Retrieving Capability Values</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG> reports the Boolean entry  for  <EM>id</EM>,  or  zero  if  it  is  not
       available.

       <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG> obtains the numeric entry for <EM>id</EM>, or -1 if it is not available.

       <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>  returns  the  string  entry  for  <EM>id</EM>,  or  <EM>NULL</EM>  if  it is not
       available.   Use  <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  to  output  the  string  returned.   The  <EM>sbuf</EM>
       parameter is used as follows.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   It is assumed to be the address of a pointer to a buffer managed by
           the calling application.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   However, <EM>ncurses</EM> checks to ensure that <EM>sbuf</EM> is not <EM>NULL</EM>,  and  that
           the  pointer  obtained  by dereferencing <EM>sbuf</EM> is also not <EM>NULL</EM>.  If
           either check fails, <EM>ncurses</EM> ignores <EM>sbuf</EM>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   If the checks succeed, <EM>ncurses</EM> also copies the return value to  the
           buffer  pointed  to  by <EM>sbuf</EM>, and the library updates <EM>sbuf</EM> to point
           past the null character terminating this value.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The return  value  itself  is  an  address  in  the  terminal  type
           description loaded into memory.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Applying-String-Capabilities">Applying String Capabilities</a></H3><PRE>
       String capabilities can be parameterized; see subsection "Parameterized
       Strings" in  <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>.  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> applies its second and third arguments
       to  the  parametric  placeholders in the capability stored in the first
       argument.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The capability may contain padding specifications;  see  subsection
           "Delays  and  Padding"  of <STRONG><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></STRONG>.  The output of <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> should
           thus be passed to <STRONG>tputs</STRONG> rather than some other output function such
           as <STRONG>printf(3)</STRONG>.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   While  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  is  assumed  to  be used for the two-parameter cursor
           positioning  capability,  <EM>termcap</EM>  applications  also  use  it  for
           single-parameter capabilities.

           Doing  so  reveals  a  quirk  in <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>: most hardware terminals use
           cursor addressing with <EM>row</EM> first, but the  original  developers  of
           the  <EM>termcap</EM>  interface  chose  to  put  the <EM>col</EM> (column) parameter
           first.  The <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> function swaps the order of its  parameters.   It
           does  this  even  for  calls requiring only a single parameter.  In
           that case, the first parameter is merely a placeholder.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   Normally the <EM>ncurses</EM>  library  is  compiled  without  full  <EM>termcap</EM>
           support.  In that case, <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> uses an internal version of <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">tparm(3x)</A></STRONG>
           (a more capable function).

           Because it uses <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> internally, <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> is able to use  some  <EM>term-</EM>
           <EM>info</EM>  features, but not all.  In particular, it allows only numeric
           parameters; <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> supports string parameters.

           However, <STRONG>tparm</STRONG> is not  a  <EM>termcap</EM>  feature,  and  portable  <EM>termcap</EM>
           applications should not rely upon its availability.

       <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  is described in <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">curs_terminfo(3x)</A></STRONG>.  It can retrieve capabilities
       by either <EM>termcap</EM> or <EM>terminfo</EM> code.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Global-Variables">Global Variables</a></H3><PRE>
       <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> sets the variables <STRONG>PC</STRONG>, <STRONG>UP</STRONG>, and <STRONG>BC</STRONG> to the <EM>terminfo</EM> entry's  data
       for  <STRONG>pad_char</STRONG>  (<STRONG>pad</STRONG>), <STRONG>cursor_up</STRONG> (<STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>), and <STRONG>backspace_if_not_bs</STRONG> (<STRONG>OTbs</STRONG>),
       respectively.    <EM>ncurses</EM>   does    not    employ    <STRONG>cuu1</STRONG>    internally.
       <STRONG><A HREF="curs_util.3x.html">delay_output(3x)</A></STRONG>  uses  <STRONG>pad</STRONG>,  while  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  emulation uses the obsolete
       <EM>termcap</EM> capability <STRONG>bs</STRONG>,  represented  in  <EM>ncurses</EM>  <EM>terminfo</EM>  as  "OTbs".
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  assigns  the variable <STRONG>ospeed</STRONG> a system-specific value to encode
       the terminal's data rate.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Releasing-Memory">Releasing Memory</a></H3><PRE>
       The <EM>termcap</EM> functions provide  no  means  of  freeing  memory,  because
       legacy  <EM>termcap</EM>  implementations  used only the storage provided by the
       caller via <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> and <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>.  Those buffers are unused in <EM>terminfo</EM>.

       By contrast, <EM>terminfo</EM>  allocates  memory.   It  uses  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">setupterm(3x)</A></STRONG>  to
       obtain  the  data  used  by  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>  and  the  functions that retrieve
       capability values.  One could use
              del_curterm(cur_term);
       to free this memory, but  there  is  an  additional  complication  with
       <EM>ncurses</EM>.  It uses a fixed-size pool of storage locations, one per value
       of the terminal name parameter given to <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>.  The <STRONG>screen(1)</STRONG> program
       relies upon this arrangement to improve its performance.

       An  application  that  uses only the <EM>termcap</EM> functions, not the higher-
       level <EM>curses</EM> API,  could  release  the  memory  using  <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">del_curterm(3x)</A></STRONG>,
       because the pool is freed using other functions; see <STRONG><A HREF="curs_memleaks.3x.html">curs_memleaks(3x)</A></STRONG>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-RETURN-VALUE">RETURN VALUE</a></H2><PRE>
       The  return  values  of  <STRONG>tgetent</STRONG>,  <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG>,  <STRONG>tgetname</STRONG>, and <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> are
       documented above.

       <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG> returns <EM>NULL</EM> on error.  Error conditions include:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   uninitialized state (<STRONG>tgetent</STRONG> was not called successfully),

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>cap</EM> being a null pointer,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>cap</EM> referring to a canceled capability,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>cap</EM> being a  capability  with  string-valued  parameters  (a  <EM>term-</EM>
           <EM>info</EM>-only feature), and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>cap</EM> being a capability with more than two parameters.

       See <STRONG><A HREF="curs_terminfo.3x.html">curs_terminfo(3x)</A></STRONG> regarding <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-NOTES">NOTES</a></H2><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  compares  only the first two characters of the <EM>id</EM> parameter of
       <STRONG>tgetflag</STRONG>, <STRONG>tgetnum</STRONG>, and <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG> to the capability names in the database.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       These functions are no longer standardized  (and  the  variables  never
       were);  see  section "HISTORY" below.  <EM>ncurses</EM> provides them to support
       legacy applications; they should not be used in new programs.

       SVr4 describes a successful return value  only  as  "an  integer  value
       other than <EM>ERR</EM>".

       Neither  X/Open  Curses  nor  the  SVr4 man pages documented the return
       values of <EM>tgetent</EM> correctly, though all three shown here were  in  fact
       returned  ever  since  SVr1.   In particular, an omission in the X/Open
       Curses specification has  been  misinterpreted  to  mean  that  <EM>tgetent</EM>
       returns  <EM>OK</EM>  or  <EM>ERR</EM>.   Because  the  purpose  of these functions is to
       provide compatibility with the <EM>termcap</EM> library, that  is  a  defect  in
       X/Open Curses Issue 4 Version 2 rather than in <EM>ncurses</EM>.

   <STRONG>Compatibility</STRONG> <STRONG>with</STRONG> <STRONG>BSD</STRONG> <EM>termcap</EM>
       <EM>ncurses</EM>  provides  externally  visible  variables  to  support  certain
       <EM>termcap</EM>  applications.   However,  their  correct   usage   is   poorly
       documented; for example, it is unclear when reading and writing them is
       meaningful.  In particular, some applications are reported  to  declare
       and/or modify <EM>ospeed</EM>.

       The  constraint  that only the first two characters of the <EM>id</EM> parameter
       are looked  up  in  the  terminal  database  escapes  many  application
       developers.   The  BSD  <EM>termcap</EM> library did not require a trailing null
       character after the capability identifier passed to  <EM>tgetstr</EM>,  <EM>tgetnum</EM>,
       and <EM>tgetflag</EM>.  Some applications thus assume that the <EM>termcap</EM> interface
       does not  require  the  trailing  null  character  for  the  capability
       identifier.  <EM>ncurses</EM> disallows matches by the <EM>termcap</EM> interface against
       extended capability names that are  longer  than  two  characters;  see
       <STRONG><A HREF="user_caps.5.html">user_caps(5)</A></STRONG>.

       The BSD <EM>termcap</EM> function <EM>tgetent</EM> returns the text of a <EM>termcap</EM> entry in
       the buffer  passed  as  an  argument.   <EM>ncurses</EM>,  like  other  <EM>terminfo</EM>
       implementations, does not store terminal type descriptions as text.  It
       sets the buffer contents to a null-terminated string.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Header-File">Header File</a></H3><PRE>
       <EM>ncurses</EM> includes a <EM>termcap.h</EM> header file for compatibility  with  other
       implementations,   but   it   is   rarely   used   because   the  other
       implementations are not mutually compatible; see below.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       Bill Joy originated a forerunner  of  <EM>termcap</EM>  called  "ttycap",  dated
       September 1977, and released in 1BSD (March 1978).  It used many of the
       same function names as the later <EM>termcap</EM>, such  as  <EM>tgetent</EM>,  <EM>tgetflag</EM>,
       <EM>tgetnum</EM>, and <EM>tgetstr</EM>.

       A  clear  descendant, the <EM>termlib</EM> library, followed in 2BSD (May 1979),
       adding <EM>tgoto</EM> and <EM>tputs</EM>.  The former applied at that time only to cursor
       positioning  capabilities,  thus  the  overly  specific  name.   Little
       changed in 3BSD (late 1979) except the addition of test programs and  a
       <EM>termlib</EM>  man page, which documented the API shown in section "SYNOPSIS"
       above.

       4BSD (November 1980) renamed <EM>termlib</EM> to <EM>termcap</EM> and added another  test
       program.   The  library  remained  much  the  same through 4.3BSD (June
       1986).   4.4BSD-Lite  (June  1994)  refactored  it,  leaving  the   API
       unchanged.

       Function  prototypes were a feature of ANSI C (1989).  The library long
       antedated the standard and thus provided no header file declaring them.
       Nevertheless,  the  BSD sources included two different <EM>termcap.h</EM> header
       files over time.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   One was used internally by <STRONG>jove(1)</STRONG> from 4.3BSD onward.  It declared
           global symbols for the <EM>termcap</EM> variables that it used.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   The  other appeared in 4.4BSD-Lite Release 2 (June 1995) as part of
           <EM>libedit</EM> (also known as the <EM>editline</EM> library).  CSRG source  history
           shows that this was added in mid-1992.  The <EM>libedit</EM> header file was
           used  internally  as  a  convenience  for  compiling  the  <EM>editline</EM>
           library.  It declared function prototypes, but no global variables.
           NetBSD's <EM>termcap</EM> library added this header file in mid-1994.

       Meanwhile, GNU <EM>termcap</EM> began development in 1990.   Its  first  release
       (1.0)  in  1991  included  a  <EM>termcap.h</EM>  header file.  Its second (1.1)
       release in September 1992 modified  the  file  to  use  <EM>const</EM>  for  the
       function  prototypes in the header where one would expect parameters to
       be read-only.  BSD <EM>termcap</EM> did  not.   The  prototype  for  <EM>tputs</EM>  also
       differed,  but  in that instance, it was <EM>libedit</EM> that differed from BSD
       <EM>termcap</EM>.

       GNU <STRONG>bash(1)</STRONG> has bundled GNU <EM>termcap</EM> 1.3 since mid-1993 to  support  its
       <STRONG>readline(3)</STRONG> library, and continues to use it if configured to do so.

       <EM>ncurses</EM>  1.8.1 (November 1993) provided a <EM>termcap.h</EM> file.  It reflected
       influence  from  GNU  <EM>termcap</EM>  and  <STRONG>emacs(1)</STRONG>  (rather  than   <STRONG>jove(1)</STRONG>),
       providing the following interface:

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   global symbols used by <EM>emacs</EM>,

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <EM>const</EM>-qualified function prototypes, and

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   a prototype for <EM>tparam</EM>, a GNU <EM>termcap</EM> feature.

       Later  (in mid-1996) the <EM>tparam</EM> function was removed from <EM>ncurses</EM>.  Any
       two of the four implementations thus differ, and programs  that  intend
       to work with all <EM>termcap</EM> library interfaces must account for that fact.

       X/Open  Curses  Issue 4,  Version 2  (1996), describes these functions,
       marking them as "TO BE WITHDRAWN".

       X/Open Curses Issue 7 (2009) withdrew the <EM>termcap</EM> interface (along with
       the <EM>vwprintw</EM> and <EM>vwscanw</EM> functions).

       If  you  call  <STRONG>tgetstr</STRONG>  to  fetch  <STRONG>column_address</STRONG>  (<STRONG>ch</STRONG>)  or  any  other
       parameterized string capability, be aware that it is returned in  <EM>term-</EM>
       <EM>info</EM> notation, not the older and not-quite-compatible <EM>termcap</EM> notation.
       This does not cause problems if all you do with it  is  call  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  or
       <STRONG>tparm</STRONG>,   which   both   parametrically   expand  <EM>terminfo</EM>-style  string
       capabilities as <EM>terminfo</EM> does.  (If <EM>ncurses</EM> is  configured  to  support
       <EM>termcap,</EM>  <STRONG>tgoto</STRONG>  checks whether the string is <EM>terminfo</EM>-style by looking
       for "<STRONG>%p</STRONG>" parameters or "<STRONG>&lt;</STRONG>...<STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>"  delays,  and  invokes  a  <EM>termcap</EM>-style
       parser if the string appears not to use <EM>terminfo</EM> syntax.)

       Because  <EM>terminfo</EM>'s  syntax  for padding in string capabilities differs
       from <EM>termcap</EM>'s, users can be surprised.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>tputs("50")</STRONG> in a <EM>terminfo</EM> system transmits "50" rather  than  busy-
           waiting for 50 milliseconds.

           However,  if  <EM>ncurses</EM> is configured to support <EM>termcap</EM>, it may also
           have been configured to support BSD-style padding.  In  that  case,
           <STRONG>tputs</STRONG>  inspects  strings  passed  to  it, looking for digits at the
           beginning of the string.

       <STRONG>o</STRONG>   <STRONG>tputs("50")</STRONG> in a <EM>termcap</EM> system may busy-wait for  50  milliseconds
           rather than transmitting "50".

       <EM>termcap</EM>  has  nothing  analogous  to  <EM>terminfo</EM>'s  <STRONG>set_attributes</STRONG>  (<STRONG>sgr</STRONG>)
       capability.  One consequence is that <EM>termcap</EM> applications  assume  that
       "<STRONG>me</STRONG>"  (equivalent  to <EM>terminfo</EM>'s <STRONG>exit_attribute_mode</STRONG> (<STRONG>sgr0</STRONG>) capability)
       does not reset the alternate character set.  <EM>ncurses</EM> inspects the  data
       shared  with  the  <EM>termcap</EM>  interface  and  modifies it as necessary to
       accommodate the latter's limitation in this respect.
