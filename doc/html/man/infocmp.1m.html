</PRE><H2><a name="h2-DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION</a></H2><PRE>
       <B>infocmp</B>  can  be  used  to  compare  a binary <B>terminfo</B> entry with other
       terminfo entries, rewrite a <B>terminfo</B> description to take  advantage  of
       the  <B>use=</B>  terminfo field, or print out a <B>terminfo</B> description from the
       binary file (<B>term</B>) in a variety of formats.  In all cases, the  boolean
       fields  will be printed first, followed by the numeric fields, followed
       by the string fields.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Default-Options">Default Options</a></H3><PRE>
       If no options are specified and zero or one  <I>termnames</I>  are  specified,
       the <B>-I</B> option will be assumed.  If more than one <I>termname</I> is specified,
       the <B>-d</B> option will be assumed.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Comparison-Options-_-d_-_-c_-_-n_">Comparison Options [-d] [-c] [-n]</a></H3><PRE>
       <B>infocmp</B>  compares  the  <B>terminfo</B>  description  of  the  first  terminal
       <I>termname</I>  with  each  of  the descriptions given by the entries for the
       other terminal's <I>termnames</I>.  If a capability is defined for only one of
       the   terminals,  the  value  returned  depends  on  the  type  of  the
       capability:

       <B>o</B>   <B>F</B> for missing boolean variables

       <B>o</B>   <B>NULL</B> for missing integer or string variables

       Use the <B>-q</B> option to show the distinction between <I>absent</I> and  <I>cancelled</I>
       capabilities.

       These  options  produce a list which you can use to compare two or more
       terminal descriptions:

       <B>-d</B>   produces a list of each capability that is <I>different</I>  between  two
            entries.   Each  item  in  the list shows ":" after the capability
            name, followed by the capability values, separated by a comma.

       <B>-c</B>   produces a list of each capability that is <I>common</I> between  two  or
            more entries.  Missing capabilities are ignored.  Each item in the
            list  shows  "="  after  the  capability  name,  followed  by  the
            capability value.

            The  <B>-u</B>  option  provides  a  related  output,  showing  the first
            terminal description rewritten to use the  second  as  a  building
            block via the "use=" clause.

       <B>-n</B>   produces  a  list  of each capability that is in <I>none</I> of the given
            entries.  Each item in the list shows "!"  before  the  capability
            name.

            Normally only the conventional capabilities are shown.  Use the <B>-x</B>
            option to add the BSD-compatibility capabilities  (names  prefixed
            with "OT").

            If  no  <I>termnames</I> are given, <B>infocmp</B> uses the environment variable
            <B>TERM</B> for each of the <I>termnames</I>.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Source-Listing-Options-_-I_-_-L_-_-C_-_-r_">Source Listing Options [-I] [-L] [-C] [-r]</a></H3><PRE>
       The <B>-I</B>, <B>-L</B>, and <B>-C</B> options will  produce  a  source  listing  for  each
       terminal named.

            <B>-I</B>   use the <B>terminfo</B> names
            <B>-L</B>   use the long C variable name listed in &lt;<B>term.h</B>&gt;
            <B>-C</B>   use the <B>termcap</B> names
            <B>-r</B>   when using <B>-C</B>, put out all capabilities in <B>termcap</B> form
            <B>-K</B>   modifies the <B>-C</B> option, improving BSD-compatibility.

       If  no  <I>termnames</I> are given, the environment variable <B>TERM</B> will be used
       for the terminal name.

       The source produced by the <B>-C</B> option may be used directly as a  <B>termcap</B>
       entry,  but not all parameterized strings can be changed to the <B>termcap</B>
       format.  <B>infocmp</B> will attempt to  convert  most  of  the  parameterized
       information,  and  anything not converted will be plainly marked in the
       output and commented out.  These should be edited by hand.

       For best results when converting to <B>termcap</B> format, you should use both
       <B>-C</B>  and  <B>-r</B>.   Normally a termcap description is limited to 1023 bytes.
       <B>infocmp</B> trims away less essential parts to make it  fit.   If  you  are
       converting to one of the (rare) termcap implementations which accept an
       unlimited size of termcap, you may want to add  the  <B>-T</B>  option.   More
       often  however,  you  must  help  the  termcap implementation, and trim
       excess whitespace (use the <B>-0</B> option for that).

       All padding information for strings  will  be  collected  together  and
       placed  at  the  beginning  of  the  string  where  <B>termcap</B> expects it.
       Mandatory padding (padding information with a trailing "/") will become
       optional.

       All  <B>termcap</B>  variables  no longer supported by <B>terminfo</B>, but which are
       derivable from other <B>terminfo</B>  variables,  will  be  output.   Not  all
       <B>terminfo</B>  capabilities  will  be translated; only those variables which
       were part of <B>termcap</B> will normally be output.  Specifying the <B>-r</B> option
       will  take off this restriction, allowing all capabilities to be output
       in <I>termcap</I> form.  Normally you would use both the <B>-C</B>  and  <B>-r</B>  options.
       The  actual  format  used  incorporates  some  improvements for escaped
       characters  from  terminfo  format.   For  a  stricter   BSD-compatible
       translation, use the <B>-K</B> option rather than <B>-C</B>.

       Note  that  because  padding  is  collected  to  the  beginning  of the
       capability, not all capabilities are output.  Mandatory padding is  not
       supported.   Because  <B>termcap</B>  strings  are  not as flexible, it is not
       always possible  to  convert  a  <B>terminfo</B>  string  capability  into  an
       equivalent <B>termcap</B> format.  A subsequent conversion of the <B>termcap</B> file
       back into <B>terminfo</B> format will not necessarily reproduce  the  original
       <B>terminfo</B> source.

       Some  common  <B>terminfo</B>  parameter sequences, their <B>termcap</B> equivalents,
       and some terminal types which commonly have such sequences, are:

           <B>terminfo</B>                    <B>termcap</B>   Representative Terminals
           ---------------------------------------------------------------

</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Use_-Option-_-u_">Use= Option [-u]</a></H3><PRE>
       The <B>-u</B> option produces a  <B>terminfo</B>  source  description  of  the  first
       terminal  <I>termname</I>  which  is  relative  to the sum of the descriptions
       given by the entries for the other terminals <I>termnames</I>.  It  does  this
       by  analyzing  the differences between the first <I>termname</I> and the other
       <I>termnames</I> and producing a description with <B>use=</B> fields  for  the  other
       terminals.  In this manner, it is possible to retrofit generic terminfo
       entries into a terminal's description.  Or, if  two  similar  terminals
       exist, but were coded at different times or by different people so that
       each description is a full description, using <B>infocmp</B>  will  show  what
       can be done to change one description to be relative to the other.

       A capability will be printed with an at-sign (@) if it no longer exists
       in the first <I>termname</I>, but one of the other <I>termname</I> entries contains a
       value for it.  A capability's value will be printed if the value in the
       first <I>termname</I> is not found in any of the other <I>termname</I> entries, or if
       the  first of the other <I>termname</I> entries that has this capability gives
       a different value for the capability than that in the first <I>termname</I>.

       The order of the other <I>termname</I>  entries  is  significant.   Since  the
       terminfo  compiler  <B>tic</B>  does a left-to-right scan of the capabilities,
       specifying two <B>use=</B> entries that contain differing entries for the same
       capabilities will produce different results depending on the order that
       the entries are given in.  <B>infocmp</B> will flag any  such  inconsistencies
       between the other <I>termname</I> entries as they are found.

       Alternatively, specifying a capability <I>after</I> a <B>use=</B> entry that contains
       that capability will cause the  second  specification  to  be  ignored.
       Using  <B>infocmp</B>  to recreate a description can be a useful check to make
       sure that everything was specified correctly  in  the  original  source
       description.

       Another  error  that  does not cause incorrect compiled files, but will
       slow down the compilation time, is specifying extra  <B>use=</B>  fields  that
       are superfluous.  <B>infocmp</B> will flag any other <I>termname</I> <I>use=</I> fields that
       were not needed.

   <B>Changing</B> <B>Databases</B> <B>[-A</B> <I>directory</I>] [-B <I>directory</I>]
       Like  other  <B>ncurses</B>  utilities,  <B>infocmp</B>  looks   for   the   terminal
       descriptions   in  several  places.   You  can  use  the  <B>TERMINFO</B>  and
       <B>TERMINFO_DIRS</B> environment variables to override the compiled-in default
       list of places to search (see <B><A HREF="curses.3X.html">curses(3X)</A></B> for details).

       You  can  also use the options <B>-A</B> and <B>-B</B> to override the list of places
       to search when comparing terminal descriptions:

       <B>o</B>   The <B>-A</B> option sets the location for the first <I>termname</I>

       <B>o</B>   The <B>-B</B> option sets the location for the other <I>termnames</I>.

       Using these options, it is  possible  to  compare  descriptions  for  a
       terminal  with  the  same name located in two different databases.  For
       instance, you can use this feature for comparing descriptions  for  the
       same terminal created by different people.


</PRE><H3><a name="h3-Other-Options">Other Options</a></H3><PRE>
       <B>-0</B>   causes the fields to be printed on one line, without wrapping.

       <B>-1</B>   causes the fields to be printed out one to a line.  Otherwise, the
            fields will be printed several to a line to a maximum width of  60
            characters.

       <B>-a</B>   tells  <B>infocmp</B>  to  retain  commented-out capabilities rather than
            discarding them.  Capabilities are  commented  by  prefixing  them
            with a period.

       <B>-D</B>   tells <B>infocmp</B> to print the database locations that it knows about,
            and exit.

       <B>-E</B>   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as tables,  needed  in
            the   C   initializer  for  a  TERMTYPE  structure  (the  terminal
            capability structure in the <B>&lt;term.h&gt;</B>).  This option is useful  for
            preparing  versions  of  the  curses library hardwired for a given
            terminal type.  The tables are all declared static, and are  named
            according  to  the type and the name of the corresponding terminal
            entry.

            Before ncurses 5.0, the split between the <B>-e</B> and  <B>-E</B>  options  was
            not  needed;  but  support  for extended names required making the
            arrays  of  terminal  capabilities  separate  from  the   TERMTYPE
            structure.

       <B>-e</B>   Dump the capabilities of the given terminal as a C initializer for
            a TERMTYPE structure (the terminal  capability  structure  in  the
            <B>&lt;term.h&gt;</B>).   This  option  is useful for preparing versions of the
            curses library hardwired for a given terminal type.

       <B>-F</B>   compare terminfo files.  This assumes that two following arguments
            are  filenames.   The  files  are  searched  for  pairwise matches
            between entries, with two entries considered to match  if  any  of
            their  names  do.   The  report  printed  to standard output lists
            entries with no matches in the other file, and entries  with  more
            than  one match.  For entries with exactly one match it includes a
            difference report.  Normally, to reduce the volume of the  report,
            use  references  are  not resolved before looking for differences,
            but resolution can be forced by also specifying <B>-r</B>.

       <B>-f</B>   Display complex terminfo strings which contain  if/then/else/endif
            expressions indented for readability.

       <B>-G</B>   Display  constant  literals  in  decimal  form  rather  than their
            character equivalents.

       <B>-g</B>   Display constant character literals in  quoted  form  rather  than
            their decimal equivalents.

       <B>-i</B>   Analyze  the  initialization (<B>is1</B>, <B>is2</B>, <B>is3</B>), and reset (<B>rs1</B>, <B>rs2</B>,
            <B>rs3</B>),  strings  in  the  entry,  as  well  as   those   used   for
            starting/stopping  cursor-positioning  mode (<B>smcup</B>, <B>rmcup</B>) as well
            as starting/stopping keymap mode (<B>smkx</B>, <B>rmkx</B>).

            For each string, the code tries to  analyze  it  into  actions  in
            terms  of  the  other capabilities in the entry, certain X3.64/ISO
            6429/ECMA-48 capabilities, and certain DEC VT-series private modes
            (the  set  of  recognized  special sequences has been selected for
            completeness over the existing terminfo  database).   Each  report
            line  consists  of  the  capability  name, followed by a colon and
            space, followed by a printable expansion of the capability  string
            with   sections   matching   recognized  actions  translated  into
            {}-bracketed descriptions.

            Here is a list of the DEC/ANSI special sequences recognized:

            6429/ECMA  Set  Graphics  Rendition, with the values NORMAL, BOLD,
            UNDERLINE, BLINK, and REVERSE.  All but  NORMAL  may  be  prefixed
            with

            <B>o</B>   "+" (turn on) or

            <B>o</B>   "-" (turn off).

            An  SGR0  designates  an  empty  highlight sequence (equivalent to
            {SGR:NORMAL}).

       <B>-l</B>   Set output format to terminfo.

       <B>-p</B>   Ignore padding specifications when comparing strings.

       <B>-Q</B> <I>n</I> Rather than show source  in  terminfo  (text)  format,  print  the
            compiled  (binary) format in hexadecimal or base64 form, depending
            on the option's value:

               1  hexadecimal

               2  base64

               3  hexadecimal and base64

            For example, this prints the compiled terminfo value as  a  string
            which could be assigned to the <B>TERMINFO</B> environment variable:

                infocmp -0 -q -Q2

       <B>-q</B>   This makes the output a little shorter:

            <B>o</B>   Make  the  comparison listing shorter by omitting subheadings,
                and using "-" for absent capabilities, "@" for canceled rather
                than "NULL".

            <B>o</B>   However,   show   differences  between  absent  and  cancelled
                capabilities.

            <B>o</B>   Omit the "Reconstructed from" comment for source listings.

       <B>-R</B><I>subset</I>
            Restrict output to a given subset.  This option is  for  use  with
            archaic  versions of terminfo like those on SVr1, Ultrix, or HP/UX
            that do not support the full set of SVR4/XSI Curses terminfo;  and
            variants  such  as AIX that have their own extensions incompatible
            with SVr4/XSI.

            <B>o</B>   Available terminfo subsets are  "SVr1",  "Ultrix",  "HP",  and
                "AIX"; see <B><A HREF="terminfo.5.html">terminfo(5)</A></B> for details.

            <B>o</B>   You  can  also  choose  the  subset  "BSD"  which selects only
                capabilities with termcap equivalents  recognized  by  4.4BSD.
                The <B>-C</B> option sets the "BSD" subset as a side-effect.

            <B>o</B>   If  you  select  any  other value for <B>-R</B>, it is the same as no
                subset, i.e.,  all  capabilities  are  used.   The  <B>-I</B>  option
                likewise selects no subset as a side-effect.

       <B>-s</B> <I>[d|i|l|c]</I>
            The  <B>-s</B>  option sorts the fields within each type according to the
            argument below:

            <B>d</B>    leave fields in  the  order  that  they  are  stored  in  the
                 <I>terminfo</I> database.

            <B>i</B>    sort by <I>terminfo</I> name.

            <B>l</B>    sort by the long C variable name.

            <B>c</B>    sort by the <I>termcap</I> name.

            If  the  <B>-s</B>  option  is  not given, the fields printed out will be
            sorted alphabetically by  the  <B>terminfo</B>  name  within  each  type,
            except  in  the  case of the <B>-C</B> or the <B>-L</B> options, which cause the
            sorting to be done by the <B>termcap</B> name  or  the  long  C  variable
            name, respectively.

       <B>-T</B>   eliminates  size-restrictions  on  the  generated  text.   This is
            mainly  useful  for  testing  and  analysis,  since  the  compiled
            descriptions  are  limited  (e.g.,  1023  for  termcap,  4096  for
            terminfo).

       <B>-t</B>   tells <B>tic</B> to discard commented-out  capabilities.   Normally  when
            translating  from terminfo to termcap, untranslatable capabilities
            are commented-out.

       <B>-U</B>   tells <B>infocmp</B> to not  post-process  the  data  after  parsing  the
            source  file.   This  feature  helps  when  comparing  the  actual
            contents of two source files, since  it  excludes  the  inferences
            that <B>infocmp</B> makes to fill in missing data.

       <B>-V</B>   reports the version of ncurses which was used in this program, and
            exits.

       <B>-v</B> <I>n</I> prints out tracing information on standard error  as  the  program
            runs.

            The  optional  parameter  <I>n</I>  is  a number from 1 to 10, inclusive,
            indicating the desired level of detail of information.  If ncurses
            is  built  without  tracing  support,  the  optional  parameter is
            ignored.

       <B>-W</B>   By itself, the <B>-w</B>  option  will  not  force  long  strings  to  be
            wrapped.  Use the <B>-W</B> option to do this.

       <B>-w</B> <I>width</I>
            changes the output to <I>width</I> characters.

       <B>-x</B>   print information for user-defined capabilities (see <B>user_caps(5)</B>.
            These are extensions to  the  terminfo  repertoire  which  can  be
            loaded using the <B>-x</B> option of <B>tic</B>.

       /usr/share/terminfo Compiled terminal description database.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-HISTORY">HISTORY</a></H2><PRE>
       Although  System  V  Release  2  provided a terminfo library, it had no
       documented tool for decompiling the terminal descriptions.  Tony Hansen
       (AT&amp;T) wrote the first <B>infocmp</B> in early 1984, for System V Release 3.

       Eric  Raymond  used  the  AT&amp;T  documentation  in  1995  to  provide an
       equivalent <B>infocmp</B> for ncurses.   In  addition,  he  added  a  few  new
       features such as:

       <B>o</B>   the   <B>-e</B>   option,   to  support  <I>fallback</I>  (compiled-in)  terminal
           descriptions

       <B>o</B>   the <B>-i</B> option, to help with analysis

       Later, Thomas Dickey added the <B>-x</B> (user-defined  capabilities)  option,
       and  the  <B>-E</B>  option  to  support  fallback  entries  with user-defined
       capabilities.

       For a complete list, see the <I>EXTENSIONS</I> section.

       In 2010, Roy Marples provided an <B>infocmp</B> program  for  NetBSD.   It  is
       less  capable  than  the  SVr4  or ncurses versions (e.g., it lacks the
       sorting options documented in X/Open), but does include the  <B>-x</B>  option
       adapted from ncurses.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-PORTABILITY">PORTABILITY</a></H2><PRE>
       X/Open  Curses,  Issue  7 (2009) provides a description of <B>infocmp</B>.  It
       does not mention the options used for converting to termcap format.


</PRE><H2><a name="h2-EXTENSIONS">EXTENSIONS</a></H2><PRE>
       The <B>-0</B>, <B>-1</B>, <B>-E</B>, <B>-F</B>, <B>-G</B>, <B>-Q</B>, <B>-R</B>, <B>-T</B>, <B>-V</B>, <B>-a</B>, <B>-e</B>, <B>-f</B>, <B>-g</B>, <B>-i</B>, <B>-l</B>, <B>-p</B>,  <B>-q</B>
       and <B>-t</B> options are not supported in SVr4 curses.

       SVr4   infocmp  does  not  distinguish  between  absent  and  cancelled
       capabilities.  Also, it shows missing integer capabilities as  <B>-1</B>  (the
       internal   value   used   to   represent   missing   integers).    This
       implementation shows those as  "NULL",  for  consistency  with  missing
       strings.

       The  <B>-r</B>  option's  notion of "termcap" capabilities is System V Release
       4's.  Actual BSD curses versions will have a more restricted  set.   To
       see only the 4.4BSD set, use <B>-r</B> <B>-RBSD</B>.
