SHORT-TERM TO-DO ITEMS:

Bugs:

* Users of older System V UNIXes (but not Solaris, and probably not SVr4)
  may trip over a known problem with the signal-handling code which causes
  abrupt termination of ncurses applications following resume from a ^Z
  suspend (this problem was first seen running lynx).  You will not see 
  this problem if you are running Linux or one of the 4.4BSD derivatives
  like FreeBSD, NetBSD, or BSDI.  For details, see the analysis in the
  header comment of ncurses/lib_tstp.c.

* We need a portable vsscanf() implementation.  Currently the library links
  a stub.

* The window classes defined in the c++ subdirectory need documentation.

Untested features:

* The code for the HP color model using set_color_pair is untested.

* The code for handling soft labels on a terminal type with built-in support
  for them (num_labels > 0, label_height, label_width, label_format, label_off,
  label_on, plab_norm, lab_f*) has not been tested.  The label_format and
  lab_f* capabilities aren't presently used.

LONGER-TERM TO-DO ITEMS:

1. Extended mouse support via gpm integration

We have mouse support under xterm now, implemented and documented.  The
next step is to add code to lib_mouse.c that can detect Alessandro Rubini's
GPM server and use it to implement the same interface.

2. Extended COSE conformance

There is an XPG4 standard recently released which describes a superset
of the SVr4 API.  The library is BASE conformant with this standard.
We would like to make ncurses fully conformant at the EXTENDED level
supporting internationalization.

Here are page references to all material involving wide or multi-byte
characters in Issue 4 of the XSI Curses standard, with notes on their
status in this implementation:

Basically, the macro superstructure is there but the core is absent.  We
need better multi-locale support guarantees from the OS to finish this.
If you are working on internationalization support, please contact us so
we can cooperate.

3. DOS port

Only 16 of the 55 files in the library depend on the terminfo format.
It should be possible to further kernelize the package, then rewrite 
a small number of core files to produce a functionally-compatible
port that would do updates to a memory-mapped screen area.  The first
result of this would be a DOS port.

4. X port

It would be nice if ncurses could recognize when it was running under X and
maintain its own window.  With this feature, all ncurses programs would
automatically become X programs.  The challenge is to handle resize events
properly.

5. Unused capabilities

The currently unused capabilities fall naturally into several groups:

A. Status-line capabilities:

	Booleans: has_status_line, status_line_esc_ok.
	Numerics: width_status_line.
	Strings: dis_status_line, from_status_line, to_status_line.

System V Release 1 curses made no use of these at all.  SVr4's use, if
any, is unknown.  From the AT&T termcap file it looks like curses, in general,
shouldn't use them; terminal variants with status lines have their line count
decremented by 1, suggesting that curses is supposed to leave the status line
alone.

B. Printer capabilities:

	Boolean: col_addr_glitch, cr_cancels_micro_mode, has_print_wheel,
		row_addr_glitch, semi_auto_right_margin, cpi_changes_res,
		lpi_changes_res.
	Numeric: buffer_capacity, dot_horz_spacing, dot_vert_spacing,
		max_micro_address, max_micro_jump, micro_col_size,
		micro_line_size, number_of_pins, output_res_char,
		output_res_line, output_res_horz_inch, print_rate,
		wide_char_size, bit_image_entwining, bit_image_type.
	String: down_half_line, form_feed, up_half_line, set_left_margin,
		set_right_margin, clear_margins, change_char_pitch
		... set_page_length (all the SVr4 printer caps),

Curses doesn't use these.

C. Printer-control capabilities:

	Boolean: prtr_silent.
	Strings: print_screen, prtr_on, prtr_off, prtr_non.

Curses doesn't use these.

D. Dialer strings:

	Strings: hangup, dial_phone, quick_dial, tone, pulse, flash_hook,
		fixed_pause, wait_tone.

Curses doesn't use these.

E. Window and virtual-terminal capabilities:

	Numerics: maximum_windows, virtual_terminal.
	Strings: req_for_input, create_window, goto_window, set_window.

These seem to be fossils from some AT&T experiments on character-based
window systems that never escaped the lab.  The virtual_terminal cap had
something to do with building terminal emulations into tty line disciplines.

F. Unused VDT capabilities:

	Booleans: erase_overstrike, has_meta_key, insert_null_glitch,
		move_insert, dest_tabs_magic_smso, transparent_underline,
		needs_xon_xoff, hard_cursor.
	Numerics: lines_of_memory, buttons.
	Strings: pkey_key, pkey_local, pkey_xmit, underline_char, 
		enter_xon_mode,	exit_xon_mode, xon_character, xoff_character, 
		display_clock, remove_clock, user[0-5], display_pc_char,
		enter_scancode_mode, exit_scancode_mode, pc_term_options, 
		scancode_escape, alt_scancode_esc.

These are the potentially important ones for ncurses.  Notes:

	i) ncurses doesn't need move_insert; it never uses cup/hpa/vpa while
		insert_mode is on.

	ii) We probably don't care about dest_tabs_magic_smso; only
		Telerays used it and they're all long obsolete.
